"""scitex-cards wake-watcher — push side of the self-consuming board loop.

Polls the YAML store on a fixed interval (default 30s, hard floor 10s —
raised from 2s after the 2026-07-08 death-spiral incident), diffs
against the previous snapshot, and POSTs to the owning agent's local
sac a2a ``/v1/turn`` endpoint when:

  * a NEW task is added (``task.id`` absent from the previous snapshot);
  * a comment is appended (``len(task.comments)`` grew);
  * status flipped (``previous.status != current.status``).

Wake payload is small + stable so a future Gitea-webhook variant can
emit the same shape::

    {
      "trigger":      "scitex-cards-watcher",
      "trigger_kind": "task_added" | "comment" | "status_changed",
      "task_id":      "<id>",
      "task_title":   "<title>",
      "summary":      "<short human-readable change description>",
      "store_path":   "/scitex-cards/tasks.yaml"
    }

The agent's harness (e.g. claude-code container) handles the rest:
runs ``scitex-cards next --mine --json``, picks the top task, works it,
flips status, comments. See ``_skills/scitex-cards/32_agent-self-
consumption-loop.md`` for the canonical 7-step loop.

Agent registry (where to find each peer's a2a port):

  A ``agents:`` top-level list in tasks.yaml. Each entry:
  ``{name: scitex-cards, a2a_port: 41234}``. This static list is
  scitex-cards's own SSoT for the agent port table — no external
  runtime is consulted.

Per-agent debounce: at most ONE wake per ``min_wake_interval`` seconds
per agent. Prevents a hot-loop when an agent comments on its own task
several times in quick succession.

Fan-out (P2, ADR-0009): each detected change wakes the card OWNER
(``agent`` / ``assignee``) AND every entry in the card's persistent
``subscribers`` list (the P1 notify field). Recipients are DEDUPED —
an owner who also appears in ``subscribers`` is woken once — and the
existing per-agent debounce still applies, so a busy card never floods
any one recipient. A card with no subscribers behaves exactly as
before (owner-only); a card with subscribers but no owner still wakes
its watchers.
