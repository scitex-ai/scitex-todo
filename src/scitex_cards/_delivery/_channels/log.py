"""The slice-1 concrete channel: a stdlib-``logging`` delivery sink.

:class:`LogChannel` is the no-creds-needed channel that proves the delivery
loop end-to-end: it writes ONE human-readable line per notification via the
stdlib logging logger and reports ``sent``. It is registered under the
``scitex_cards.delivery_channels`` entry-point group (see pyproject.toml) so
the registry discovers it automatically, and it is the default address-less
channel every user can be given without any external configuration.
