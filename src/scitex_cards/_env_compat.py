"""``SCITEX_CARDS_*`` / ``SCITEX_TODO_*`` environment dual-read (transition).

The package rename (scitex-todo -> scitex-cards, 2026-07-16) renames every
environment-variable prefix from ``SCITEX_TODO_`` to ``SCITEX_CARDS_``. The
codebase still READS the old names at ~50 sites; rewriting them all inside
the mechanical rename PR would tangle two risky changes into one diff. So
this module — imported FIRST by ``scitex_cards.__init__`` — MIRRORS every
``SCITEX_CARDS_<X>`` value onto ``SCITEX_TODO_<X>`` in this process's
environment:

- a shell that already exports the NEW names (the operator's ``.envrc``)
  works today, and child processes inherit the mirrored pair;
- the un-cutover fleet exporting only OLD names keeps working, with ONE
  deprecation warning per process (operator-requested, 2026-07-16);
- when BOTH names are set to different values, the NEW name wins, loudly —
  EXCEPT in the two cases below, where the new value is not trustworthy.

The read sites migrate to the new names in the store-engine stage; this
mirror then inverts and finally dies together with the ``scitex_todo`` shim.

WHY THIS MODULE NOW REFUSES SOME OVERRIDES (incident 2026-07-19)
---------------------------------------------------------------
"The new name wins" is the right policy for a DELIBERATE migration. It was
implemented as an UNCONDITIONAL overwrite, and that is a different thing: it
means a malformed new-prefix value silently defeats a working old-prefix one.
Measured on the live fleet, from the MCP server's own ``/proc/<pid>/environ``:

    SCITEX_TODO_DB        = ~/.scitex/todo/cards.db    (2117 cards)
    SCITEX_CARDS_DB       = ~/.scitex/cards/cards.db   (5 cards)
    SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID  = scitex-cards
    SCITEX_CARDS_AGENT_ID = ${SCITEX_CARDS_AGENT_ID}   <- literal

Both overrides applied. The store silently FORKED: agents wrote into an empty
store while the fleet's history sat untouched in the other one, and every card
written carried ``created_by: ${SCITEX_CARDS_AGENT_ID}``. A hard SQLite cutover
seeded from "the resolved store" would have built the database from 5 cards and
destroyed 2117 — the fork was the only thing between a correct-sounding
instruction and total loss.

The upstream defect (a spec template that did not expand) is not ours. Turning
somebody else's config bug into silent data loss IS ours. Hence two refusals:

1. An UNEXPANDED value is not a value. ``${FOO}`` reaching a process means an
   expansion failed; treating it as data propagates the failure into the store.
2. A rename must not silently RELOCATE a mutable data store. If the two names
   disagree and the OLD path exists with content, that is a fork, not a
   migration.

Both refuse LOUDLY and keep the old value. Refusing is safe (the pre-rename
configuration keeps working); accepting is not (it strands writes).
