"""scitex-todo MCP server — one FastMCP instance per the SciTeX convention.

Tools follow audit §6 Convention A (``tool_name == python_api_name``); see
``TOOL_NAMES`` for the full registered set (task CRUD + edges + roles, the
``help_wait`` / ``help_clear`` cards, ``poll_notifications`` — the standalone
PULL card-message inbox — and the ``todo_skills_*`` §5 pair).

Three cohesive tool clusters live in sibling modules for this module's line
budget and register on the SAME ``mcp`` instance (imported at the tail for the
side effect): :mod:`scitex_cards._mcp_write` (``add_task`` + ``update_task`` —
the two tools whose signatures carry the whole card schema, so they grow with
every field), :mod:`scitex_cards._mcp_relations` (edges + roles) and
:mod:`scitex_cards._mcp_skills` (skills, help-wait, DMs, inbox, health). The
agent-facing instructions text lives in :mod:`scitex_cards._mcp_instructions`.

The task-store tool surface is a thin wrapper around :mod:`scitex_cards._store`
(the Python API) so MCP / CLI / GUI all share one logic path — §6 Python-API
parity. JSON-shape parity: every tool returns a JSON-string of the dict /
list the Python API returns.

Import semantics
----------------
``fastmcp`` is an OPTIONAL dependency (``pip install scitex-todo[mcp]``).
Importing this module without fastmcp installed raises :class:`ImportError`
with a clear install hint — it does NOT raise at ``import scitex_cards``
time (the CLI guards the import; the MCP `start` verb surfaces the same
hint as a click error).

# `mcp` and `_ENUM_FIELDS` now live in `_mcp_app`, a LEAF module — it imports
# nothing that imports it back. They are re-exported here because 8 modules and
# the CLI already do `from ._mcp_server import mcp`, and that surface must not
# move.
#
# THIS IS NOT COSMETIC. The satellites (`_mcp_write`, `_mcp_relations`,
# `_mcp_skills`, `_mcp_channel`) need `mcp` to decorate with, and THIS module
# imports THEM at its tail for the registration side effect. When `mcp` lived
# here, that was a cycle: importing a satellite FIRST raised ImportError, because
# it pulled in `_mcp_server`, which reached its tail and asked the satellite for
# names it had not defined yet. Hoisting the shared symbol to a leaf is what
# breaks it — see `_mcp_app`'s docstring for why a lazy re-export would have
# silently unregistered two tools instead.

# NOTE on the CURRENCY gate (scitex_cards._currency.check_currency): it does
# NOT live here at module level. It used to (2026-07-21), and
# `tests/scitex_cards/test__import_order.py` correctly caught that as a bug:
# `import scitex_cards._mcp_server` raised a real StalenessError in a fresh
# subprocess whose env carries none of the test suite's suppression pins.
# Importing a module must be side-effect-free — same principle that exempts a
# docs build. The gate now lives at the actual SERVER-START call site instead:
# see `_attach_unified_start`'s `start()` handler in `_cli/_mcp.py`, which
# covers `scitex-cards mcp start` (both the stdio-unified and `--http`
# branches). A client that launches this module directly, bypassing that CLI
# (e.g. `fastmcp run scitex_cards._mcp_server:mcp`), is NOT gated — FastMCP
# does offer a `lifespan=` hook on `FastMCP(...)`, but wiring it here is
# unsafe: `_mcp_channel._run()` drives `mcp._mcp_server` (the low-level
# server) by hand for the stdio-unified path, entering `server.lifespan(server)`
# directly rather than through `FastMCP.run()`/`_lifespan_manager()`, and a
# non-default `lifespan=` in that shape raises `RuntimeError("... no lifespan
# result is set ...")` — i.e. it would break the DEFAULT `mcp start` command
# it was meant to protect. Left as a known, honestly-disclosed gap rather than
# a half-fixed lifespan wiring.
