"""Card LIFECYCLE verbs — the state transitions of an existing card.

Split out of ``_store`` (PURE MOVE — no behaviour change), which re-exports
every name below so ``from ._store import complete_task`` keeps working:

    complete_task   done + ``_log_meta.completed_{at,by}`` (idempotent).
    resolve_task    blocked → done, blocker cleared, audit comment.
    reopen_task     done → blocked/``operator-decision`` (the Resolve→Undo).
    reassign_task   atomic owner change (agent+assignee+scope in lock-step).
    delete_task     remove + scrub inbound refs (returns the Undo payload).
    restore_task    the Delete→Undo partner.

The shared helpers (``_read_write_doc`` / ``_utc_now_iso`` / ``_default_agent``
/ ``TaskNotFoundError``) stay in ``_store`` and are imported HERE inside the
function bodies — a deferred import, because ``_store`` imports this module at
module level to re-export its verbs and a top-level import back would cycle.
Same pattern the code already used for ``from . import _model``.
