"""Delete-with-Undo handlers — remove a task / re-insert it losslessly.

Extracted from ``crud.py`` (512-line file cap). These two endpoints cannot
delegate to the ``_store`` verbs: the frontend's Undo round-trips
``refs = [{id, field}, ...]`` (which OTHER task pointed at the deleted one,
and through WHICH field), while ``_store.delete_task`` returns bare id
strings and ``_store.restore_task`` does not re-apply refs at all. So each
handler instead holds ``_store_lock`` across a FRESH read-modify-write of
the global store — the same chokepoint every ``_store`` verb uses — closing
the old lost-update window (cache read -> in-memory mutate -> whole-list
save, clobbering any concurrent write in between).
