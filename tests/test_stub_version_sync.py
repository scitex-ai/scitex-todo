"""The deprecation stub's version tracks the main package, release for release.

The stub (stub/scitex-todo/) publishes from the SAME tag as scitex-cards; a
forgotten bump would either fail the upload (duplicate version) or, worse,
leave old `scitex-todo` pins resolving to a stub that requires an older
scitex-cards than the one being released. A version the release ritual can
forget is a version a test must pin.

#: The stub's pyproject — the single artefact every test below reads.
STUB_PYPROJECT = REPO / "stub" / "scitex-todo" / "pyproject.toml"

#: WHY the console-script tests below are split but share this rationale:
#: the stub MUST recreate BOTH CLIs because it installs LAST in an upgrade.
#: Old scitex-todo wheels (0.13.x-0.15.x) own bin/scitex-todo AND
#: bin/scitex-cards in their RECORD, so upgrading deletes BOTH — and pip
#: processes dependencies first, so scitex-cards' own reinstall cannot save
#: them. The stub is the final dist processed in that transaction; its script
#: declarations are what puts the binaries back (card
#: scitex-cards-alias-destroyed-by-uninstall-order-collision-20260717,
#: venv-matrix verified 2026-07-18). Dropping EITHER line silently revives the
#: fleet-wide CLI kill, which is why each line gets its own test: when one
#: regresses, the failure names which binary died.
