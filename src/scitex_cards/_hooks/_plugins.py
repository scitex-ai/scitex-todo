"""Entry-point plugin discovery + bounded dispatch for the hook bus.

Split out of the original flat ``_hooks.py`` (C2 refactor). Holds the
entry-point group constant, the per-plugin wall-time budget + env knob,
the ordered/bounded :func:`_run_plugins`, and the cross-version
:func:`_iter_entry_points`.

## C2 — per-plugin wall-time budget (the headline fix)

The original ``_run_plugins`` called ``fn(event)`` with NO time budget,
so a slow/hung external entry-point plugin blocked the WHOLE producer
(the root cause behind the earlier comment-post slowness). C2 runs each
handler in a worker thread and ``join(timeout)``s it so a hung plugin
can NEVER hang dispatch.

What is PRESERVED (other code depends on it):

  * Sequential, ordered execution by ``(priority, name)``. The
    ``ci-result`` / owner-map chain relies on an early ``critical``
    handler MUTATING the shared ``event`` dict BEFORE a later handler
    reads it, so handlers still run ONE AT A TIME, in order — never
    parallelised. The handler mutates the shared dict IN its thread;
    after a successful ``join`` the main thread sees the mutations
    (fine under the GIL — the join is a happens-before edge).
  * On RAISE inside the thread: caught into ``plugin_errors``; if the
    handler is ``critical`` the chain ABORTS and the exception
    re-raises (byte-for-byte the original contract).
  * The ``(count, plugin_errors)`` return contract; ``count`` still
    counts loaded handlers.

What is NEW:

  * On TIMEOUT: a ``plugin_errors`` entry shaped like the existing ones
    plus ``"timeout": true``; a warning is logged; if the timed-out
    handler is ``critical`` the chain ABORTS and raises (delivering
    downstream off a handler that did not finish is worse than
    aborting).

### Daemon-thread limitation (documented, intentional)

Python cannot force-kill a thread. The worker thread is therefore a
DAEMON: when it times out we stop WAITING for it, but the hung plugin
keeps running in the background until it returns on its own or the
process exits (a daemon thread does not block interpreter shutdown).
The leak is bounded — it dies with the process — and is strictly
better than the alternative (hanging the producer forever). The env
knob lets an operator widen the budget if a legitimately-slow plugin
is being clipped.
