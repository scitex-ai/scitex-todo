"""DB → JSON export: the backup/audit rail of ADR-0010.

The operator's ruling (2026-07-16): the DATABASE is the single source of
truth; backup = periodically EXPORT a JSON snapshot *from* the DB and git-
snapshot that export. Git tracks an export, never live data — which is what
retires the "dotfiles working tree IS the live store" merge hazard.

Exactness contract
------------------
Every entity is reconstructed from its VERBATIM ``*_json`` payload
(``tasks.card_json`` — v2; ``users/notifications/messages.record_json`` — v3),
never from typed columns: a column-based rebuild would drop unknown keys and
reorder the rest. A NULL payload means the row predates its payload column and
the DB was never re-imported — the export REFUSES loudly rather than emit a
stripped record.

The columns that legitimately MUTATE in the DB after import (``seen`` on a
notification, ``read`` on a message, ``last_seen`` on a user) are overlaid
onto the payload so a post-cutover export reflects live state, not the
import-time snapshot of those flags.

    Tasks come back in document order (``row_order``); inbox and thread
    records in insertion (rowid) order — matching how the exported lists grew.

    ``conn`` — READ THE EXPORT AND ITS VERIFICATION FROM ONE SNAPSHOT.
    A caller that must cross-check this export against the database (see
    :func:`scitex_cards._store._read_canonical_db_or_raise`) cannot re-count on
    a SECOND connection: the store is WAL, so two connections take two
    INDEPENDENT snapshots taken however long the export took apart, and any
    concurrent writer in that window makes the two disagree with no card
    missing at all. That false "INCOMPLETE" refusal blanked ``list_tasks``
    fleet-wide (observed 2,374 exported vs 2,375 in-table while
    ``scitex-cards db verify`` reported the DB perfectly healthy).

    So the caller opens ONE connection, begins ONE read transaction, and hands
    it here. When ``conn`` is supplied it is used as-is and NOT closed —
    ownership stays with the caller, whose transaction defines the snapshot
    both the export and the verifying ``COUNT(*)`` observe. ``db_path`` is
    ignored in that case (the connection already names the database).

    The connection MUST have been opened through :func:`scitex_cards._db.connect`
    (directly or via :func:`open_db`), because that is where the
    min-client-version gate lives. Hand-rolling a bare ``sqlite3.connect`` here
    would silently delete that gate.
