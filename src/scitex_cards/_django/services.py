"""Board service -- resolve + load the task store with a small mtime cache.

Mirrors figrecipe's ``services.get_or_create_editor`` shape but read-only: the
board never mutates the store in this MVP, so the "board" is just the validated
task list plus its resolved path and mtime. The cache avoids re-reading the
YAML on every poll while still picking up external edits (cache is keyed by
path and invalidated when the file's mtime changes).

Per-project lane UNION (operator-validated requirement, lead a2a
`1ceec0ef` + `40c0a42d`, 2026-06-13)
-------------------------------------
Skill 30 describes a two-tier model: a global user-scope store
PLUS hand-curated per-project lanes (``~/proj/<repo>/.scitex/todo/
tasks.yaml``). Pre-this-change the loader resolved to ONE store at a
time, so the operator's nv-lessons (and 31 other neurovista cards
that live in ``~/proj/neurovista/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml``) were
INVISIBLE on the board.

The board's task set is now the UNION of:
  - the global store (resolved by :func:`resolve_tasks_path`), AND
  - every per-project lane discovered by globbing
    :data:`SCITEX_TODO_LANE_GLOBS` (default
    ``~/proj/*/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml``).

Collision policy: **project-lane wins** on duplicate ids. Rationale:
human hand-curation beats agent auto-write. Each collision is logged
(``logger.warning``) so silent overrides are visible.

Resilience: a malformed per-project lane is SKIPPED + LOGGED — the
board still renders the rest. Per-lane crash-loud, never whole-view.
