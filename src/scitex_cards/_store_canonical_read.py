"""THE ONE FAIL-LOUD READER of the canonical store. Every door shares it.

Extracted verbatim from :mod:`scitex_cards._store` (which is a thin
orchestrator over focused siblings) so the guard, the incident history that
justifies each of its checks, and its tests sit in one place instead of being
buried among the mutation helpers. ``_store`` re-exports it, so every historical
import — ``from ._store import _read_canonical_db_or_raise`` — is unchanged.

Three callers, ONE policy, deliberately:

    _store._read_write_doc      the read-modify-write cycle behind every CRUD verb
    _model.load_doc             the pure-read path (``load_tasks`` → ``list_tasks``)
    _store_backend.write_doc_to_db   by inheritance

That single chokepoint is the point. On 2026-07-19 the write door refused a
foreign store correctly all day while the read door happily returned its rows,
and a packaged fixture was read AS THE BOARD for hours because of it. Do NOT
split this into a lenient read variant and a strict write variant — that
recreates exactly the asymmetry that outage was made of.

    """Read the whole store from SQLite for a read-modify-write. FAILS LOUD.

    THE BUG THIS REPLACES turned a READ error into TOTAL DATA LOSS, three times
    on 2026-07-19. The old line was::

        doc = export_doc(None)[0] or {}

    Read-modify-write means whatever this returns is what gets WRITTEN BACK as
    the canonical store. So ``or {}`` does not mean "no cards found" — it means
    "delete every card", and it says so to nobody. Any reason the export came
    back empty (a stamp naming another store, an unreadable DB, a resolution
    that landed on the wrong path) is silently promoted from a failed read into
    an authoritative empty board. Measured: 2,138 cards -> 3, from one
    ``comment_task`` call.

    #507's own commit message predicted this exact shape ("2065 cards down to
    1") for ``load_doc`` and guarded that one. The identical hazard sat in the
    sibling expression and was not — which is the same lesson as the two write
    doors: fixing one instance of a pattern is not fixing the pattern.

    A store with genuinely zero cards is legitimate ONLY when the DB has no
    tasks table content to begin with; that case returns an empty doc honestly.
    Every other emptiness is a failed read and raises, because refusing to
    write is always recoverable and writing nothing over everything is not.

    """Export the store AND count its rows from ONE WAL read snapshot.

    WHY ONE SNAPSHOT, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX. The cross-check at the
    bottom of this function is only evidence if both numbers describe the SAME
    database state. They used to not: the export ran on ``export_doc``'s own
    connection while the verifying ``COUNT(*)`` ran on a second, separately
    opened read-only one. The store is WAL, so those are two INDEPENDENT
    snapshots taken an export-duration apart (~1.25s on the live 2,379-card
    board). Any other agent writing in that window makes ``exported <
    in_table`` with NO card missing and nothing wrong — and the guard then
    refuses a perfectly healthy read.

    Not hypothetical: ``list_tasks`` refused fleet-wide at 2,374-vs-2,375 while
    ``scitex-cards db verify`` reported ``quick_check=ok``, and a background
    writer inserting one row every 100ms reproduces it 10/10 (0/10 with the
    writer off). The exported count consistently tracked the table as it had
    been one export-duration earlier — the signature of a stale snapshot, not
    of a lost card.

    AN ALWAYS-REFUSING GUARD IS THE SAME USELESSNESS AS AN ALWAYS-PASSING ONE,
    and this package has already shipped that shape: the S2 read accelerator
    (deleted in 256bc2d1) had a freshness check that could never pass again
    once SQLite became canonical, so it refused unconditionally and fell back
    to serving an empty board. So the fix is emphatically NOT a tolerance
    window, a retry-until-equal loop, a swallowed mismatch, or a flag — every
    one of those silences the gate rather than repairing it. It is to make the
    comparison snapshot-consistent and leave the verdict exactly as strict.

    ``BEGIN DEFERRED`` takes the WAL read snapshot at the first read statement
    and holds it until rollback, so the ``COUNT(*)`` sees precisely the rows the
    export walked. A concurrent writer can no longer come between them, while
    an export that genuinely under-reports the rows it was handed still
    disagrees with the count — the failure this exists to catch, unchanged.

    THE CONNECTION COMES FROM ``open_db``, NOT a hand-rolled ``sqlite3.connect``.
    :func:`scitex_cards._db.connect` is where the min-client-version gate runs,
    and an outdated client must ERROR the moment it opens the store rather than
    warn. Opening a raw connection here to "keep the check independent" would
    silently delete that gate — and independence was never the property that
    made this check real. Asking the TABLE something the EXPORTER cannot fake
    is, and that survives sharing a connection: the exporter assembles ``tasks``
    from the ``card_json`` payloads it walks, while ``COUNT(*)`` asks the table
    how many rows are actually there.
