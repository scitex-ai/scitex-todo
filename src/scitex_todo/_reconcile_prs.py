"""Deterministic card-freshness automation: auto-close a card once its
linked PR has MERGED.

Most ``in_progress`` / ``blocked`` (and some ``pending``) cards represent
work that ends in a merged PR. The card's ``pr_url`` field is the soft link
(set by the git-link feature / authors). This module scans those cards,
asks GitHub whether the linked PR is merged, and — for the ones that are —
flips the card to ``done`` (reusing :func:`scitex_todo._store.complete_task`)
plus an audit comment. It is the periodic counterpart of the manual
``complete_task`` / ``resolve_task`` verbs so nobody has to hand-update the
board after a merge lands.

Design (mirrors the rest of the package)
----------------------------------------
* **Pure decision core.** :func:`decide_reconcile_action` is a pure
  function over ``(task, merge_state)`` → an action label. No I/O. This is
  what the tests assert against directly.
* **PR-URL parser.** :func:`parse_pr_url` deterministically extracts
  ``(owner, repo, number)`` from the GitHub PR URL shapes we see in the
  field. Unparseable → ``None`` (treated as "unknown → skip").
* **Merge-state seam.** The network call is factored behind a callable
  (``merge_state_fn``) exactly like the package's other entry-point seams
  (``entry_points=`` on the hook dispatch, the watch-ci fault injection).
  The default implementation prefers ``gh pr view`` (the dashboard HOST has
  ``gh``) and falls back to a ``curl`` GitHub REST call. Tests inject a
  fake callable returning ``"merged"`` / ``"open"`` / ``"unknown"`` with
  no network and no mocks.
* **Fail-soft.** Any parse / network / subprocess failure resolves to
  ``"unknown"`` → the card is left untouched. We NEVER wrongly close.
* **Default DRY-RUN.** :func:`reconcile_merged_prs` reports only unless
  ``apply=True`` (mirrors scitex-dev's board-mutation pattern — no silent
  auto-close).

Idempotency: a card already ``done`` is skipped (never re-stamped), and
``complete_task`` is itself idempotent, so a double run is safe.
