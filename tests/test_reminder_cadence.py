"""A parked card must not drag the digest onto a faster clock.

Regression cover for the 2026-07-12 digest-spam incident. sac received digests
#649 / #650 / #651 inside TWELVE MINUTES, each listing 97 cards of which ~86
were deliberately deferred — cards they had already triaged and consciously
parked. The digest was re-asking, every five minutes, a question the owner had
already answered.

Cause: the digest merges two sweeps with deliberately different clocks —
detect_stale_active (2 h) and detect_pending_backlog (24 h) — into one bucket,
then took a single min() of per-card intervals across BOTH. With
DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 5, one actionable card put the owner's ENTIRE
backlog on a five-minute loop.

That is the same wrong as charging a deferred card against an agent's WIP: it
punishes the owner for the honesty of parking something, and a channel that
interrupts you about decided work is a channel you learn to ignore.
