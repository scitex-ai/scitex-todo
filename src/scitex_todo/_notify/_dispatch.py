"""Notify DISPATCHER: deliver card-events to resolved recipients (foundation C4).

This is **C4** of the card-event / notification foundation epic — the
RESOLVER-DRIVEN delivery layer that turns a canonical card-event
(:mod:`scitex_todo._events`) into actual per-recipient pushes. It is the
single built-in CONSUMER of ``kind == "card-event"`` on the hook bus:
:func:`scitex_todo._hooks.dispatch_event` lazily calls
:func:`dispatch_notifications` for every card-event (see the wiring in
:mod:`scitex_todo._hooks._dispatch`).

It stitches together the already-merged foundation pieces, reusing each
as SSOT (no reinvention):

* :func:`scitex_todo._notify.resolve_recipients` (C3) — *which* user-ids
  should be notified for this event on this card.
* :func:`scitex_todo._inbox.enqueue` (the standalone PULL rail) — the
  ACTUAL delivery: append the notification to each recipient's inbox.

## NO fleet-spam — resolver-driven, not broadcast

Delivery targets ONLY the set :func:`resolve_recipients` returns, minus
the actor (we never notify the cause of the event). There is no fan-out
to "every agent" — the notify-config layer (global rules + per-user
mute/watch + per-card overrides) is the single authority on the
recipient set.

## Fail-soft contract (the dispatcher MUST never break a mutation)

A card-event is emitted from inside a board mutation (reassign, complete,
a git-link push, …) via :func:`scitex_todo._events.emit`, which already
swallows bus errors. C4 adds a SECOND layer of isolation:

* the whole dispatch is wrapped fail-soft at the bus wiring point so a
  delivery hiccup can never make ``emit()`` raise;
* **per-recipient** isolation here — one inbox enqueue raising for a
  recipient must NOT stop the others.

## Standalone PULL-inbox sink — the ONLY (and always-works) delivery rail

A direct turn-URL POST CANNOT reach a *containerized* agent — the agent
subscribes outbound to a bus and refuses a direct inbound POST (connection
refused). It also makes the EMITTING mutation wait on a slow/unreachable
network target. So C4's delivery is purely the per-recipient PULL-inbox
(:mod:`scitex_todo._inbox`): it **enqueues** each resolved recipient's
notification into the inbox, persisted in the same store with ZERO sac
dependency and ZERO network. The recipient's scitex-todo client then POLLs
that inbox (``poll_notifications`` MCP tool). The enqueue is FAIL-SOFT: an
inbox error can never break the mutation or ``emit()``.

The dispatcher NO LONGER makes a synchronous direct-POST to turn-urls
(it used to call :func:`scitex_todo._push.deliver` here, which failed for
containers and slowed the mutation). :func:`scitex_todo._push.deliver` /
``turn_url_for`` stay in the codebase for other callers; a future
NON-BLOCKING push accelerator (e.g. sac's optional C10 out-of-band wake)
can re-add a host-reachable fast-path WITHOUT putting the network back on
the mutation's critical path.

## ``deliver_fn`` parameter (kept for back-compat; no longer called)

:func:`dispatch_notifications` still ACCEPTS a ``deliver_fn`` parameter so
existing callers/tests do not break, but the dispatcher no longer invokes
it synchronously — the inbox enqueue is the delivery. Tests assert on the
``enqueued`` summary (and that a deliberately-raising ``deliver_fn`` is
never called), exercising the real inbox round-trip — no ``unittest.mock``,
no monkeypatch of the wire (STX-NM / PA-306-compliant).

        :func:`get_user`. ``None`` resolves via the normal precedence chain.
    deliver_fn : callable, optional
        ACCEPTED for back-compat (the old direct-POST injection seam) but
        NO LONGER CALLED — the dispatcher delivers purely via the inbox, so
