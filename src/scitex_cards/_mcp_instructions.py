"""The scitex-cards MCP server's agent-facing instructions text.

Every agent reads this string at session start — it is the single most-read
sentence the package ships, so it gets its own module (extracted from the
budget-bound :mod:`scitex_cards._mcp_server`) and its own tests.

Why the identity is INTERPOLATED
--------------------------------
The instructions used to hard-code ONE example scope — the ``proj-scitex-cards``
identity. That identity does not exist: the ``proj-`` prefix is a dead legacy
naming (see :data:`scitex_cards._users.IDENTITY_PREFIXES`, which exists to STRIP
it). An agent that followed the instruction filtered on a scope holding almost
nothing and reasonably concluded the board had no work for it. Measured against
the live store on 2026-07-11: **2** cards scoped to the dead ``proj-scitex-cards``
vs **63** scoped to the real ``scitex-cards``. A mechanical explanation for the
standing "the fleet ignores the board" complaint.

So the scope is now rendered from the agent's OWN id — resolved by the package's
existing :func:`scitex_cards._channel_identity.resolve_agent_id_optional`
(``$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID``) — and when that identity is UNRESOLVABLE we name NO
scope at all. A silently-wrong example is worse than an honest absence: that IS
the bug. The unresolved branch instead tells the agent how to DISCOVER its slice.

        The resolved agent identity (``$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID``), or ``None`` /

        its ``agent:<id>`` scope. Without one it names NO scope — it says the
        identity is unresolved and points at ``list_tasks`` (no scope) +
        ``resolve_store`` to discover the slice, plus the env var to set.
