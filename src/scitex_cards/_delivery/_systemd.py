"""systemd user-unit TEMPLATE + install helper for the notify daemon.

Host-enablement is OPERATOR-GATED: this module only WRITES the unit file to
``~/.config/systemd/user/`` and PRINTS the exact ``systemctl --user`` commands
for the operator to run. It NEVER invokes ``systemctl`` / enables / starts the
service itself — that is a deliberate human gate (mirrors the dashboard unit
convention: ``Type=simple`` + ``Restart=on-failure`` + ``WantedBy=default.
target``).

The unit is fully STANDALONE — its ``ExecStart`` is the ``scitex-cards notifyd``
entry point (the foreground run), with no external federation dependency.

ExecStart MUST BE ABSOLUTE
--------------------------
systemd does not run the unit through a login shell and does not inherit the
user's ``PATH``. A BARE ``ExecStart=scitex-cards notifyd`` therefore dies at
``status=203/EXEC`` whenever the console script lives in a venv (it does:
``~/.env-3.11/bin/scitex-cards``) — i.e. the shipped template could not start at
all, and the operator had to hand-patch the path before the service would run.
:func:`resolve_exec_start` resolves the real path at GENERATION time (the
running interpreter's own ``bin/`` first, then ``$PATH``), and RAISES rather
than writing a unit that is guaranteed not to start.
