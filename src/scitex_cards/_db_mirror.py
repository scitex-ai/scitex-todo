"""INCREMENTAL dual-write mirror: touch only the cards that actually changed.

WHY THIS EXISTS (measured on the live 1,365-card board, 2026-07-12):

    uncontended card write : 16.31 s
      of which the mirror  :  8.69 s      <- MORE THAN HALF

S1 shipped a FULL REBUILD: ``DELETE FROM`` every doc-owned table, then re-insert
all 1,365 tasks + 3,043 comments + edges + roles. On EVERY card write. I argued
that was fine because I measured the rebuild at 1.24 s that morning and called it
noise. It is 8.69 s now — the cost grows with the board, and it more than DOUBLES
the very stall the SQLite migration exists to remove. It also doubles the
CRITICAL SECTION, which doubles the convoy for every other writer.

The full rebuild was chosen for a real reason: ``_save_doc_unlocked`` receives the
whole doc and does NOT know which card changed. This module answers that question
without needing the caller to tell it — it hashes each card and compares against
the hashes it stored last time. A typical write touches ONE card, so it does ONE
upsert instead of five thousand statements.

    reading every existing hash : one SELECT (~10 ms on 1,365 rows)
    hashing the doc            : pure Python, ~50 ms
    upserting the delta        : ~1 row

CORRECTNESS NOTES — the two ways this could quietly corrupt the mirror:

1. ``messages`` is NOT ours. It is derived from the threads.yaml SIDECAR, not from
   the doc. S1 nearly deleted every DM thread on every card write by rebuilding it;
   :data:`_db_bootstrap._DOC_CLEAR_ORDER` excludes it and so must we. A table must
   be owned by exactly the file that produces it.

2. A card leaves the mirror ONLY when a caller NAMES it (the explicit
   ``deleted_ids`` handed down from ``delete_task``) — NEVER by inferring deletion
   from a card's mere absence in the doc. Inference-from-absence is precisely what
   let a stale document wipe live cards on 2026-07-20; it is deleted, not guarded
   (see the reconcile loop below). The explicit path is a deliberate single-card
   verb with ``restore_task`` as its Undo, so it cannot mass-wipe from a stale read.

The hashes live in their own table (``mirror_hashes``), created on demand. If it
is missing or empty — a fresh DB, or one bootstrapped by the old full-rebuild
path — we fall back to a full rebuild ONCE and populate it. So this is safe to
deploy against an existing DB with no migration step.

    ``store_path`` is the canonical YAML this doc was just written to. Pass it and

    cannot say which store it reflects is a photograph with no date on it.
