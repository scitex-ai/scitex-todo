"""scitex-todo MCP tools — the card-RELATIONSHIP cluster.

Extracted from the budget-bound :mod:`scitex_cards._mcp_server` (the split its
``TOOL_NAMES`` block had queued), following the same pattern as
:mod:`scitex_cards._mcp_skills`: the tools register on the SAME shared ``mcp``
FastMCP instance, which ``_mcp_server`` imports at its tail for the
registration side effect — so ``from scitex_cards._mcp_server import mcp``
continues to expose every tool and ``TOOL_NAMES`` is unchanged.

Cluster: what a card is CONNECTED to —

  - ``set_edge`` — depends_on / blocks edges between two cards.
  - ``set_collaborator`` / ``set_subscriber`` — the ADR-0009 role lists.

Each tool is a thin wrapper around :mod:`scitex_cards._store` (§6 Python-API
parity) returning a JSON-string of what the Python API returns.
