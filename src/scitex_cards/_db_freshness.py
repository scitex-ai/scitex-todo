"""STORE IDENTITY — which store is this database THE database of?

SQLite is the store. There is no second document to be a mirror OF, so the old
"is the mirror current with the YAML" freshness question is gone: nothing on
disk moves independently of the database any more. What SURVIVES that cutover is
the narrower, load-bearing question of IDENTITY.

THE FAILURE THIS PREVENTS
-------------------------
A database file is opaque about which logical store it belongs to. Point
``$SCITEX_CARDS_DB`` at a database that was built as store B's, then write store
A into it, and nothing merges — B's rows are REPLACED with A's. That is not
hypothetical: on 2026-07-19 this package's own concurrency test rebuilt the live
fleet database from a 21-card fixture because the destination came from the
ambient environment while the source came from the caller, and nothing checked
that the two referred to the same store.

THE STAMP
---------
So every path that writes the database records WHICH STORE it is the database
of — the store's own resolved path (which, post-cutover, is the database path
itself) — into ``schema_meta`` under :data:`KEY_STORE_PATH`. A read or a write
then compares the store it resolved against that stamp. Disagree and the write
is refused: a foreign-stamped database is never clobbered.

An UNSTAMPED database is adoptable — a fresh one, or an existing one that
predates this key. The first write claims it by stamping :data:`KEY_STORE_PATH`.
This is what lets an already-populated board be adopted once, at deploy, and
then be pinned to its own identity from that write on.

WHY IDENTITY, NOT CONTENT
-------------------------
The comparison is CONTENT-INDEPENDENT on purpose: it never parses the store, it
only asks "does this database belong to the store I resolved?". That question
has a stable answer even as the board changes under it, which is exactly what a
guard on the write path needs.
