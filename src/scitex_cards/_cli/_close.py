"""CLI ``close`` verb: close a card WITH the reason recorded.

Operator + lead directive (board-reconciliation, 2026-06-13): we needed
a way to retire a stale card and *preserve the reason*. ``delete`` drops
the row, losing context; the closed-enum ``VALID_STATUSES`` has no
``"closed"`` slot, and adding one would cascade through the model /
board / docs. So the ergonomic gap is filled here:

  scitex-cards close TASK_ID --reason TEXT [--by AUTHOR] [--json] \\
      [--dry-run] [-y] [--tasks PATH]

Semantics (composition over invention):

  1. Append a structured comment ``[CLOSED] {reason}`` via
     :func:`scitex_cards._store.comment_task` — the reason is now in
     ``task.comments[]`` (Gitea-shaped activity log).
  2. Flip ``status`` to ``"cancelled"`` — the real terminal "closed as not
     planned" state. This verb previously wrote ``"deferred"`` because no
     closed-ish status existed; that overload made ``deferred`` mean both
     "closed" and "not now" at once, and TERMINAL_STATUSES resolved the
     ambiguity by treating every deferred card as closed. 354 open cards
     silently left the active board. Operator ruling 2026-07-10: "deferred
     は終了ではない" — ``deferred`` is OPEN. ``close`` writes ``cancelled``.
  3. Stamp ``_log_meta.closed_{at,by}`` (UTC ISO + author precedence
     chain identical to ``comment`` / ``done``).

Reason is REQUIRED (``click.UsageError`` if missing or empty) — the
whole point of this verb is honest reconciliation.
