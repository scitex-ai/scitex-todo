"""CLI verb ``scitex-todo triage`` — the backlog-consumption payload.

READ-ONLY. Draws an owner's pick-for-action sample (recency-weighted, see
:mod:`scitex_cards._backlog_triage`) plus their expired set, and prints it.
Mutation stays with the existing verbs (``update``, ``close``, ``comment``):
the consumer decides, this verb only puts the decision in front of them.

Primary consumer: a short-lived twin agent (sac concept, operator 2026-07-10)
spawned from its parent with the PARENT's ``SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID``, which runs
``scitex-todo triage --mine --json``, decides each drawn card (start it, name
its blocker, cancel it, or keep it), and exits. The parent never stops.
