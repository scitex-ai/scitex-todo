    # slashed path is matched cleanly instead of getting routed to
    # ``api_dispatch`` (which would 404 — no handler named
    # "fleet/ci-status"). The fleet surfaces are intentionally

    # endpoint derives per-task durations (created_to_started,
    # started_to_done, created_to_done) from the timestamps the task
    # store already carries (`created_at` + `_log_meta.started_at` +
    # `_log_meta.completed_at`) and aggregates them per agent /

    # pane + compose. `/chat` (no trailing segment — distinct from the
    # per-card `/chat/<card_id>` comment thread above) now 302-redirects to
    # `/dm` so `/dm` is the single canonical URL while old `/chat`
    # bookmarks keep working. The redirect target is the hardcoded

    # (verified). The board serves at `/`, so `/dm` is the correct target.
