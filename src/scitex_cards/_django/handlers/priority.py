"""Priority handler -- persist a drag-reorder back to the YAML task store.

The board UI is currently view-only; this handler is the first write path.
On drag-end the frontend POSTs ``{"order": ["id1", "id2", ...]}`` (graph node
ids ordered top-priority first); the handler assigns ``priority = 1..N`` to
those ids in order, leaves every other task's priority untouched, validates,
then calls ``scitex_cards.save_tasks`` to round-trip the YAML store (preserving
its hand-written comments via the ruamel writer).
