"""scitex-todo's OWN standalone channel-notification MCP server.

A long-running MCP **stdio** server that pushes unsolicited
``notifications/claude/channel`` messages into the Claude session, draining
THIS agent's scitex-todo inbox (:mod:`scitex_todo._inbox`). Claude renders
each push as ``<- scitex-todo`` in the agent's terminal — driven by
``meta.source = "scitex-todo"``.

Why a hand-rolled low-level server (NOT FastMCP)
------------------------------------------------
FastMCP constructs its ``ServerSession`` internally and never exposes it, so
a side channel (the inbox poll loop) would have no session handle to push
server-initiated ``notifications/claude/channel`` through. We therefore use
the LOW-LEVEL :class:`mcp.server.lowlevel.Server` + own the ``ServerSession``
ourselves so the poll loop can push. The initialization options MUST declare
the ``claude/channel`` experimental capability or Claude Code drops every
push ("server did not declare claude/channel capability").

The shape of this server (own-the-session + manual incoming-message drive)
is a standard MCP-channel pattern, but this module has ZERO external
runtime dependency: it drains the standalone :mod:`scitex_todo._inbox`
pull-inbox — reads scitex-todo's own inbox rows; no external runtime
import or shell-out. scitex-todo's delivery rail is fully self-contained.

Wire format (exact)
-------------------
JSON-RPC notification, method ``notifications/claude/channel``, params
``{"content": <str>, "meta": {<all-string-values>}}``. EVERY meta value MUST
be a string or Claude's Zod validator silently drops the pushed turn.

Size / burst guards (see :mod:`scitex_todo._channel_guard`). The SDK reads these
pushes through a stdio JSON reader with a hard 1 MB per-message buffer; on
2026-07-02, 180 solver containers died on boot with ``JSON message exceeded
maximum buffer size of 1048576 bytes`` when an oversized push overflowed it. Two
guards prevent that: :func:`build_channel_params` caps the body at
``MAX_CONTENT_BYTES`` (256 KiB) with a "see the card on the board" pointer, and
:func:`drain_once` pushes at most ``MAX_PUSH_PER_DRAIN`` (50) records per tick so
a backlog can never burst all at once on first connect.

Headless / solver capsules (no push): with NO ``$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID`` set the
unified server (``scitex-todo mcp start``) runs TOOLS-ONLY — the poll loop is not
started and the session receives ZERO channel pushes (see
:func:`resolve_agent_id_optional`). Intended mode for solver / headless capsules
that must not receive unsolicited pushes: just do not export the id for them.

    Reads UNSEEN records (``mark_seen=False`` — we ack ONLY after a successful

    -----
    Every store touch (:func:`recipient_keys`, :func:`_inbox.poll_inbox`,
    :func:`_inbox.ack`) is SYNCHRONOUS blocking IO (it locks + parses the whole
    YAML store). Running it inline on the event loop starves the MCP session —
    the first drain would block the ``initialize`` handshake and Claude Code
    marks the server "not connected" (grew with inbox size). So every blocking
    store call is off-loaded to a worker thread via ``anyio.to_thread.run_sync``;
    only the ``await send(...)`` push runs on the loop (it needs the session).
