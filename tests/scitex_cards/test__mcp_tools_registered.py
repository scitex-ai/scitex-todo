"""Every tool the server DECLARES must actually be REGISTERED.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-07-14): `mcp` was hoisted out of `_mcp_server` into
the `_mcp_app` leaf to break an import cycle (`_mcp_write` imported the server;
the server imported `_mcp_write` at its tail). That refactor is only correct if
`_mcp_server` STILL imports the satellite modules — because importing them is
what runs their `@mcp.tool` decorators.

THE FAILURE MODE THIS GUARDS IS SILENT. Break that tail import and nothing
raises: the server starts, reports healthy, and simply does not have `add_task`
or `update_task`. An ImportError is loud and gets fixed in a minute; a missing
tool looks like the agent "choosing" not to write. Trading a loud bug for a
quiet one is the worst possible refactor outcome, so the loudness is restored
here as a test.

This also pins the earlier lesson (`_mcp_server` split, 2026-07-13): a split must
leave the original module re-exporting its public API, or it is a rename with
extra steps.
