"""Nudge-line composition for the stale/backlog/blocked sweeps.

The PRESENTATION half of :mod:`scitex_todo._stale_active` (which keeps the
detection policy). Split out when the third sweep pushed the combined module
past the line limit — the two concerns had no reason to share a file.

Each sweep gets DISTINCT WORDING, and that is the whole point of having three:

* ``STALE-ACTIVE``  — "you can act on this now; why haven't you?"
  Fires on the TIGHT clock, and ONLY on cards the owner can actually move
  (in_progress, or blocked with no blocker named).
* ``BLOCKED-CHECK`` — "has your blocker cleared?"
  Fires on the LENIENT clock, on cards blocked on something outside the
  owner's control. It is a QUESTION, not a reprimand: telling an owner to
  "reconcile or update" a card they are powerless to move is an instruction
  they cannot follow, and 12 such nudges a day is how a channel gets tuned
  out — which is how the REAL nudge gets missed.
* ``BACKLOG``       — "start or triage what you accepted but never began."

The id-cap/"+K more" tail is implemented ONCE here (:func:`_cap_ids`); it was
previously copy-pasted verbatim into every composer.
