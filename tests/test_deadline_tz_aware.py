"""Naive and aware datetimes must never meet un-normalised.

Regression cover for the 2026-07-12 BLANK BOARD. `/graph` returned 500 and the
operator's board rendered nothing:

    _model.py:684  next_occurrence  ->  `if base >= now:`
    TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes

Chain: handle_graph -> _build_fleet -> overdue_count -> is_overdue ->
next_deadline_for_task -> _pick_next_dt -> Repeater.next_occurrence.

A bare-date deadline (`2026-07-20`) parses NAIVE. The board/fleet callers pass a
tz-AWARE UTC `now`. They met, and the compare raised.

There were TWO instances of the same bug, not one: the comparison in
`next_occurrence`, and the `min()` over a list of candidate deadlines in
`next_deadline_for_task` — which raises identically the moment a card carries one
recurring and one bare deadline. Fixing only the line in the traceback would have
left the second one armed.
