"""The board serves instantly across a store write, refreshing behind it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (operator, 2026-07-18): the board took 30+ seconds and showed
"loading…". Profiled on the live store: ``get_board`` costs **4.6 s** to
rebuild (0.01 s cached) and the cache is invalidated by EVERY store write —
so with a fleet writing every few seconds, nearly every board request paid a
full multi-MB parse. Measured end-to-end that was a 31 s board.

A board is a LIVE VIEW, not a decision read: it self-refreshes and shows a
LIVE badge, so data one refresh-cycle old is invisible to the viewer while a
31-second wait is not. So a stale board is served immediately and the rebuild
runs behind the response.

Pinned here: the stale hit is FAST, the refresh actually LANDS, a refresh
storm cannot start N rebuilds, a failing rebuild never blanks the board, and
the behaviour can be switched off. Real store files, no mocks.

    NOT ``os.utime(path, None)``, which sets the stamp to *now* and merely
    ASSUMES now is later than what the cache holds. The cache compares against
    ``effective_mtime``, and the refresh only kicks when that value MOVES.

    CONFIRMED: the flake is a missed invalidation. ``_load_global_tasks`` was
    never called (``assert 0 == 1``), which is only reachable when the board
    read judged the cache fresh — so ``utime(None)`` did not move
    ``effective_mtime`` on that run.

    NOT CONFIRMED — two mechanisms produce that and this test cannot tell them
    apart, so neither is claimed here:
      * coarse filesystem timestamps (set "now" twice inside one granule and
        the float comes back equal). Measured 0/200 collisions on the dev
        container's fs; CI's filesystem was never measured.
      * ``effective_mtime`` is a ``max()`` over the global store AND the lane
        files. Any lane file stamped later dominates the max, and bumping the
        store to "now" then changes nothing.

    Stepping the stamp explicitly past both is what makes this deterministic;
    it does not depend on which mechanism was at fault. The flake reached
    develop in #494 and turned two unrelated docs-only PRs red before it was
    traced back here.
