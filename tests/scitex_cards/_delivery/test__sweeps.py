"""Tests for the notifyd sweeps (``scitex_cards._delivery._sweeps``).

The liveness sweep is the one signal that must NOT be ignorable, so it now has
a scheduled home inside notifyd. Two properties matter and are covered here
against REAL objects (no mocks): the sweep runs on its OWN low cadence (never
in the 60 s delivery path), and a raising sweep NEVER kills the delivery loop.

The raising case is driven with a REAL failure (a malformed store makes
``load_tasks`` raise inside the guard) plus a raising fake substituted for the
sweep function the loop calls — the loop, not the sweep, is under test there.

One assertion per test (STX-TQ007): the loop drivers below run the scenario
once per test and each test checks a single property of the result.
