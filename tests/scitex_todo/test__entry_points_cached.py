"""`_iter_entry_points` discovers ONCE per process, not once per card event.

`importlib.metadata.entry_points()` re-reads every installed package's
entry_points.txt (~126 files in a real fleet venv). It runs on EVERY card event
via dispatch_event, so uncached it was the single largest cost in a card write —
sac profiled 2.18s of a 3.24s warm add_task there. This pins the cache so the
cost is paid ONCE per process, not per write.
