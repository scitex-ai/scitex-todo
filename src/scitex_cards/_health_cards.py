"""CARD-DATA invariants — "is the DATA telling the truth?"

Split out of ``_health`` (PURE MOVE for the existing check — no behaviour change),
which re-exports every name below so ``from scitex_cards._health import
_check_terminal_state_honest`` keeps working. Same contract as the ``_store_write``
and ``_mcp_server`` splits: a split must leave the original module re-exporting its
public API, or it is a rename with extra steps.

``_health`` asks whether the INSTALLATION is wired up (store resolvable, agent id
resolvable, notifyd alive, channel draining). This module asks a different question,
with different inputs and different fixes: DO THE CARDS CONTRADICT THEMSELVES?

    _check_terminal_state_honest   a closed card must not also be open, and a card
                                   that is not `done` must not carry a completion
                                   stamp.
    _check_no_falsely_blocked      a card blocked on dependencies that have ALL
                                   finished is not blocked — it is unstarted.

Both are the same species, and it is this repo's most persistent defect:
A FACT WRITTEN IN ONE PLACE AND BELIEVED IN ANOTHER, WITH NOTHING FORCING THEM TO
AGREE. Each check is one query rather than a note in a file nobody re-reads, because
AN INVARIANT NOBODY RUNS IS NOT AN INVARIANT.

def _check_terminal_state_honest(store: str | Path | None) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """ok when no card is CLOSED and OPEN at the same time.

    THE INVARIANT: a card that carries ``_log_meta.closed_at`` OR
    ``_log_meta.completed_at`` was closed. It cannot also be sitting in
    ``deferred`` / ``in_progress`` / ``blocked`` / ``goal``. If it is, the
    close DID NOT STICK, and the card is a ZOMBIE: finished work that keeps
    nagging its owner in every digest, forever.

    *** ``completed_at`` WAS ADDED ON 2026-07-14 AND THAT OMISSION IS THE
    POINT. *** This check originally named ``closed_at`` alone — one marker of
    closure — and was therefore silent on the other. Five cards on the live
    board carried ``completed_at`` while sitting in ``deferred`` /
    ``in_progress`` / ``cancelled``, and this check, whose whole job is to find
    exactly that, reported ok. A guard that enumerates ONE cause of a condition
    is an implicit claim that it is the only one; the enumeration reads as a
    promise of completeness even when nobody meant it as one. If you add a
    third closure marker, add it HERE, or this check will lie again.

    ``completed_at`` is the worse of the two to leak, because it is not merely
    ignored downstream — it is BELIEVED: ``_django/handlers/fleet/timing.py``
    and ``timeline.py`` compute throughput from ``completed_at`` alone and
    never consult ``status``. So a stamped-but-open card is counted as
    delivered work AND nags as backlog, simultaneously.

    *** THIS EXISTS BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAPPENED, TWICE, AND NOBODY NOTICED FOR
    TWO DAYS. *** (2026-07-13: `selftest-card-20260701` and
    `todo-board-reads-stale-project-store-not-canonical-20260706` both carried
    `closed_at` and both sat in `deferred`. Both had COMMENTS saying they had
    been moved to a terminal state — the prose claimed the change; the FIELD
    never took it. They were found only by hand-scanning all 1,467 rows.)

    A zombie is invisible precisely BECAUSE it looks like ordinary backlog. It
    is a signal that keeps emitting after it stopped carrying information —
    which is this codebase's recurring defect, and the reason the check is one
    query rather than a note in a file nobody re-reads. AN INVARIANT NOBODY RUNS
    IS NOT AN INVARIANT.

def _check_no_falsely_blocked(store: str | Path | None) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """ok when no card is ``blocked`` on dependencies that have ALL finished.

    THE INVARIANT: ``blocked`` is a CLAIM — "something outside my control is
    stopping me". When every card in ``depends_on`` has reached a terminal state,
    that claim is FALSE. The card is not blocked; it is merely not started. Saying
    otherwise converts "I have not done this" into "I am PREVENTED from doing
    this", which is what makes a backlog untouchable and a digest unreadable.
    (Framing owed to scitex-agent-container, 2026-07-14, who noticed they had
    deflected their own card for 109 hours by treating a status as a decision.)

    *** WHY THIS IS NOT ALREADY IMPOSSIBLE. *** The store DOES drive the unblock:
    ``_store_events._emit_unblock_for_dependents`` fires when a card completes and
    emits an "your task is now unblocked" event naming every dependent it freed.
    But AN EMIT IS A NOTIFICATION, NOT A MECHANISM — it tells the owner, and then
    nothing enforces that the owner acts. Measured on the live board 2026-07-14:
    **10 cards across 5 agents sat `blocked` with every dependency already done.**
    The notification had done its job and the field still lied.

    Same species as the completion-stamp bug fixed the same day: a fact written in
    one place and believed in another, with nothing forcing them to agree.

    DELIBERATELY REPORTS RATHER THAN AUTO-FLIPS. An owner may have an unstated
    reason, and silently rewriting another agent's card is a worse sin than naming
    the contradiction. Fail loud; do not fail clever.

    Cards blocked with NO ``depends_on`` are ignored — they name a blocker
    (``operator-decision``, ``compute``, ...) rather than a card, and this check has
    no evidence about whether that gate is still real. A DANGLING dep id is skipped
    too: treating "the gate does not exist" as "the gate is finished" would silently
    convert a data-integrity bug into an all-clear.
