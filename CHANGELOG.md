# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-16 — the package is scitex-cards now (scitex-todo stays as a shim)

### Changed
- **Package identity: `scitex-todo` → `scitex-cards`** (operator directive
  2026-07-15/16; stage 1 of the migration, card
  `scitex-cards-s1-package-identity-rename-20260716`).
  - PyPI/dist name `scitex-cards`; import package `scitex_todo` → `scitex_cards`
    (380 files, `scitex-dev rename-symbols`, CHANGELOG history left untouched).
  - Both console scripts ship and resolve to the same CLI: `scitex-cards`
    (canonical) and `scitex-todo` (legacy, kept for the un-cutover fleet).
  - MCP server identity is `scitex-cards`.
  - Entry points under `scitex_dev.*` register the new key only (those groups
    are iterated, so a legacy twin key would list the package twice — and
    `scitex_dev.jobs` would double-schedule every job).

### Added
- **`scitex_todo` import shim** — `import scitex_todo` (and any
  `scitex_todo.<submodule>`) resolves to the very same module objects as
  `scitex_cards` via a meta-path finder: one import, one module state, never a
  duplicated copy. Emits a `DeprecationWarning`; ships for one transition
  window only.
- **Environment dual-read** (`scitex_cards._env_compat`, operator-requested) —
  every `SCITEX_CARDS_<X>` env var is mirrored onto `SCITEX_TODO_<X>` at
  import, so shells already exporting the new names work today while the
  un-cutover fleet's old names keep working with one deprecation warning per
  process. When both are set, the new name wins, loudly.
- **Legacy entry-point groups honoured** — hook plugins registered under
  `scitex_todo.hooks` and delivery channels under
  `scitex_todo.delivery_channels` stay discoverable alongside the new
  `scitex_cards.*` groups until producers re-release.

### Unchanged (deliberately — later stages)
- The store path (`~/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml`) and the GitHub URLs: the store
  move is the history-migration stage; the URL flip is the repo-rename stage.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-07-13 — fix: a flag that outran its deploy cost 135 seconds per card write

### Fixed
- **`SCITEX_TODO_DUAL_WRITE` now refuses to turn on where the code cannot honour it.**

  MEASURED on a live 1,449-card store, in the configuration that was actually running:

  | | |
  |---|---|
  | scitex-todo **0.9.4**, dual-write **ON** | `add_task()` = **135.2 s** |
  | scitex-todo **0.9.4**, dual-write **OFF** | `delete_task()` = **3.8 s** |

  **35×. One flag.**

  The flag was switched on because the incremental mirror had shipped — and it *had*, on PyPI.
  But containers do not run PyPI; they run a wheel **baked into an image**, and that image was
  still 0.9.4. So the flag did not enable the incremental mirror. **It enabled the full rebuild
  that the incremental mirror had replaced** — an O(n) rewrite of every row of every table on
  every card write, which grows with the board (8.69 s at 1,370 cards; 135 s at 1,449).

  `merged != released != installed != RUNNING.`

  **The fix lives in the code, because a precondition that lives only in a conversation is not a
  precondition — it is a hope.** `enabled()` now requires the env var *and* proof that this
  process can actually do an incremental mirror.

  **The probe asks for the SYMBOL, never a version string.** It imports
  `_db_mirror.mirror_doc_incremental`. A version string is metadata, and metadata lies — a stale
  wheel, an orphaned `.dist-info`, an image baked months ago all report a version that outlived
  the code beside it. The only honest question is *"is the function here?"*, so the probe answers
  it by importing it.

  Fails **safe** (writes proceed at full speed; only the mirror is skipped, and `db import`
  rebuilds it), **loud** (ERROR, with the measured cost and the recovery path — including that a
  container restart alone will *not* update a baked wheel), and **once** per process, because the
  same message on every write is noise that teaches the reader to skip the channel.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-07-13 — cli: `scitex-cards` is a real command now

### Added
- **A `scitex-cards` console script.** The product is called SciTeX Cards, the board says so,
  and the operator typed `scitex-cards gui serve` and got `command not found`. The alias had
  been written and reviewed and was sitting in an unmerged branch — which is the same as not
  existing. It ships now.

  `scitex-cards` and `scitex-todo` are the SAME entry point: every verb, identical behaviour.
  This is the console script only — the package, the module, the MCP tool prefix and the store
  path are untouched (the full rename is a separate, coordinated effort).

## [0.9.7] - 2026-07-13 — board: it is SciTeX Cards now; two views gone, the Graph pre-rendered, a Details column added

Operator-driven overhaul of the board. Everything below was verified in a real browser against
the live 1,390-card store, not inferred from the diff.

### Removed
- **Column and Table views are gone**, along with the controls that only served them (Sort,
  Group-by, bulk-select, hide-project). Column was the DEFAULT, so the default moves to
  **Timeline**. Anyone whose browser still remembers `column` or `table` is migrated to
  Timeline on load — **not** dropped on a blank board. (This board has shipped a blank board
  twice this month; the migration is deliberate and tested.)
- **The header is quiet again**: no Reload button, no Hide-project control, no oversized
  "Blocking me" readout (the legend already says it), no `new/24h` counter in the bar.
- **The status ring around each agent icon is gone.** The icons stay — the operator likes them.
  The *ring* nobody could read: "エージェントアイコンの周りが何を表すのかよくわかりませんでした."
  It encoded status around a glyph that encodes identity, with no legend entry to decode it.
  Displayed is not the same as read.
- **Wall: one icon per agent tile**, not one per card. 50 islands, 50 icons — down from 161.

### Added
- **A Details column on the right**, built on scitex-ui's real `.stx-shell-sidebar` primitive
  rather than a bespoke layout, so the board collapses and responds like the rest of the
  ecosystem. It holds the filters, the `new/24h` counter, and:
- **A Stats panel that matches the Legend** — the same statuses, in the same order, in the same
  colours, sharing one source of truth in code. Two lists that must agree and are maintained
  separately will drift; these cannot.
- **A d/w/m timescale**, which drives (and is driven by) the Timeline's *existing* window rather
  than inventing a second, subtly-different notion of "week".
- **Timeline hover feedback**: the hovered lane highlights and only that lane's dots grow.

### Fixed
- **Search autocomplete has been silently dead.** `searchQuery.js` and `searchSuggest.js` both
  declared a top-level `const _api`; in a classic `<script>` that is one shared global binding,
  so the second file threw `Identifier '_api' has already been declared` at parse time and never
  ran. No error surfaced to the user — the dropdown simply never opened.
- **The Graph no longer freezes the page.** It is rendered off-DOM ahead of time and cached, so
  switching to it shows a finished diagram (measured: on screen within 300 ms, 1238 px inside a
  1300 px canvas — fitted, not tiny). Rendering into a `display:none` container would have
  produced a zero-width, unscaled SVG; it deliberately does not.

### Changed
- **The product is called SciTeX Cards.** Display strings only — package, CLI, MCP tool prefix
  and store path are untouched (a coordinated rename is a separate effort).

## [0.9.6] - 2026-07-13 — fix: health called a LIVE daemon dead, and the one recovery path it offered could not start

### Fixed
- **`health` reported the notify daemon DEAD while it was running and ticking.** The check read
  the pid from the pidfile and probed it with `os.kill(pid, 0)`. But notifyd runs on the HOST
  while agents run in CONTAINERS — same bind-mounted store, **different PID namespace**. The
  host's pid does not exist in the container's `/proc`, so the probe raised
  `ProcessLookupError` and the check reported "stale pidfile: pid N is not running",
  confidently, and permanently.

  **A pid is only meaningful inside the namespace that issued it.** The check was drawing a
  conclusion from a number it had no standing to interpret. Liveness across that boundary is
  now judged by **freshness, not identity**: notifyd re-stamps its pidfile every tick with
  `pid_ns` / `boot_id` / `host` / `interval` / `heartbeat`; the check probes the pid only when
  the pidfile came from *this* PID namespace, and otherwise judges by heartbeat age (3× the
  recorded interval, 60s floor). An undeterminable state now degrades to a truthful non-verdict
  instead of a false failure.

  (Hostname would NOT have worked as the discriminator — Apptainer shares the UTS namespace, so
  the container's hostname is *identical* to the host's. Only the PID namespace distinguishes
  them.)

  **Fail-loud is preserved deliberately**: a *local* daemon whose pid is gone still reports DEAD
  even with a fresh heartbeat. Freshness must not paper over a corpse we can actually see.

- **The systemd unit template could not start.** `scitex-todo notifyd install-unit` emitted
  `ExecStart=scitex-todo notifyd` — a bare command. systemd does not use your login PATH, and
  the console script lives in a venv, so the unit died with `status=203/EXEC`. The one durable
  recovery path the tool offered was itself broken. `ExecStart` is now resolved to an absolute
  path at generation time, and generation **raises** rather than writing a unit that is
  guaranteed not to start.

### CI
- **A parked workflow was manufacturing a red X on every push.** It was disabled with `on: {}`,
  which GitHub does not read as "disabled" — it treats a workflow with no valid trigger as a
  *broken file*, and created a zero-job run on every push to every branch, failing each in 0s.
  A check that is always red is not a signal; it teaches everyone that red means "that's just
  the broken one". Parked properly with `workflow_dispatch:`.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-07-13 — perf: a card write no longer drags the whole board through SQLite

Two fixes to the dual-write mirror. Together they take the mirror from **more than half of a
card write** down to **under 2% of it**.

### Performance
- **The mirror now writes only the cards that actually changed.** It used to `DELETE` and
  re-insert every row of every table on every single write — 1,370 cards and 3,073 comments
  rebuilt because you edited one card. That rebuild was **8.69 s of a 16.31 s card write**,
  and it *grew with the board* (1.24 s in the morning, 8.69 s by the evening). Worse, it ran
  **inside the store lock**, so it doubled the critical section — and therefore the convoy —
  for every other writer. It now diffs by card hash: **8.69 s → 0.199 s**. (#401)

- **The full rebuild that remains was 86% one word of SQL.** `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO tasks`
  cost **4,592 µs/row** against **110 µs/row** for a plain `INSERT` — a **42x** difference,
  and 6.3 s of the rebuild's 7.3 s. `tasks` is a *parent* of `task_comments` / `task_edges` /
  `task_roles` (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), so under `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` every REPLACE runs
  SQLite's full cascade/FK-check machinery — to resolve a collision that **cannot happen**,
  because the rebuild has just deleted every row in the same transaction.

  It was never foreign keys: `task_comments` already used a plain `INSERT`, and FK
  enforcement costs it *nothing* (150 vs 149 µs/row, FK on vs off). It is REPLACE **on a
  parent row** that is expensive. The rebuild — now the `db import` / post-failure
  re-bootstrap path — drops from **7,299 ms → 1,415 ms**, verified byte-for-byte: every row
  of all seven tables hashes identically before and after. (#402)

### Fixed
- **A duplicate card id is no longer swallowed in silence.** `INSERT OR REPLACE` absorbed it
  — and still appended *both* copies' comments. The mirror now keeps the same winner
  (last-wins) and logs the data bug loudly. Two cards cannot share an id.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-07-12 — fix: the WIP gate refused to let an agent record a P0; deadlines documented honestly

### Fixed
- **The board REFUSED to let an agent record a P0 incident.** The operator escalated a
  fleet-wide config/state-loss hazard; scitex-hub went to card it and the WIP gate said:

      WIP gate refuses add: scitex-hub already has 40 open tasks (>= 2 × limit 20).
      Close existing tasks before adding more.

  They had to bury the incident as a comment on an unrelated card — the worst outcome for
  the one class of card that most needs to be findable. A WIP cap is a **throughput-shaping**
  device and it was sitting on the **emergency-recording** path. "Your board is untidy" must
  never mean "you may not record that production is on fire."
  Worse, the old message created a **perverse incentive**: under outage pressure the cheapest
  way past the gate is to *close cards you have not finished*. A cap that pressures agents to
  falsify card state during an emergency is worse than no cap.
- **`priority <= 1` (P0/P1) is now never gated.** No flag to remember mid-outage — filing an
  incident simply works. Keyed on priority, deliberately *not* on a new `kind` enum value:
  adding an enum value would brick every agent still on a pre-0.8.0 reader, which is exactly
  the 2026-07-10 fleet outage this project already lived through.
- **The bypass is STAMPED, not silent.** A card admitted over the cap carries a
  `kind: wip-override` audit comment (the agent's WIP count and the limit), written inside the
  same locked insert. Abuse is self-reporting — and it makes priority inflation *measurable*
  rather than invisible. A silent bypass would be its own silent-absence bug.
- **The refusal message now names the emergency path** and says explicitly: *do not close
  cards you have not finished to get past this gate.*

### Changed
- **Deadlines are documented honestly.** A deadline drives no notification — nothing in the
  delivery surface (`_reminders`, `_stale_active`, `_stale_active_nudge`, `_delivery/*`) reads
  it. And a **recurring** deadline is never even *overdue*: the repeater always rolls the next
  occurrence into the future, so `is_overdue()` can never fire for one. A recurring deadline
  therefore reaches **neither** rail. This is now stated in all seven places deadlines appear —
  including the org export, which emits `DEADLINE:` lines into org-agenda (a real reminder
  engine) and so invited precisely the wrong inference. Pinned by a behavioural test: the
  sweeps produce byte-identical output with and without a deadline, plus a structural guard
  that fails if any delivery module ever starts reading one.
- If you want to be nudged: keep the card open and owned. The stale-active and backlog sweeps
  nudge on **real neglect**, which for an ongoing responsibility is the better signal anyway.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-12 — fix: `status=""` was a SILENT DELETE; clearing an enum field now deletes the key

### Fixed
- **`status=""` silently deleted the status, minting a card with no lane.** The MCP layer
  mapped `"" -> None` for *every* field, so an empty status removed the key behind the
  store's back. A status-less card has no lane on the board and drops out of every
  status-filtered view — it does not error, it simply **vanishes**. Enum fields now pass
  through verbatim and the store owns the rule.
- **Clearing a blocker with `""` was the one documented way that could not work.** The MCP
  docstring promises *"pass an empty string to CLEAR a string field"*, but on the store
  primitive `blocker=""` wrote the literal empty string and the validator then rejected the
  save:

      TaskValidationError: invalid blocker ''; must be one of
      ('compute','dependency','dep','operator-decision','agent-wait','none') or absent

  Worse, it failed at SAVE time — after the caller had built a mutation it believed valid —
  so in a bulk script it aborted the **whole batch**. Now `""` on an enum field means
  DELETE-THE-KEY, consumed in the update path before the lock is taken, so a doomed
  mutation never acquires it and `""` never reaches the validator as a value.
- The CLI could not clear `kind` at all (strict `click.Choice` rejected `''` at parse
  time), so the documented contract had no CLI form. Added, mirroring the blocker flag.

### Decisions
- `blocker` — **clearable** (`""` or whitespace-only deletes the key).
- `kind` — **clearable**; an absent `kind` already means `task`, so clearing is meaningful.
- `status` — **NOT clearable, refused loudly.** A card's status is its *decision*, not an
  optional label — the same reasoning that abolished `pending`. `status=""` now raises,
  naming the reason and the valid set, rather than being silently swallowed.

### Notes
- The validator is untouched: `blocker="banana"` still raises. The guard refusing
  `status: done` while a blocker is still set is untouched and pinned by a regression test —
  a done-but-blocked row is incoherent and that guard is correct.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-11 — fix: the MCP instructions taught a DEAD identity; agents saw 3% of their own cards

### Fixed
- **The board was telling every agent to look in an empty drawer.** The MCP server
  instructions — read by every agent at session start — hard-coded a dead example:

      "Use list_tasks with a `scope` arg (e.g. 'agent:proj-scitex-todo')"

  There is no `proj-scitex-todo`. Measured against the live store, that taught scope held
  **2** cards while the real one (`agent:scitex-todo`) held **63**. So an agent that
  *followed the shipped instructions* saw ~3% of its own work and reasonably concluded the
  board had nothing for it. Nothing errored; the query simply returned almost nothing.
  This is a mechanical explanation for the standing complaint that "the fleet ignores the
  board" — the board was not being ignored, it was lying about where to look.
- The instructions now interpolate each agent's **resolved** identity
  (`$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID`). When the identity **cannot** be resolved they say so and tell
  the agent how to discover its scope, rather than falling back to a hard-coded example. A
  silently-wrong example is worse than an honest absence — that was the entire bug.
- The same dead prefix was fixed everywhere it was taught, not just the one line: CLI
  `--help` examples, docstrings, the shipped skills, the README and the fleet cheatsheet.
- **`sync-github` was still MINTING cards under the dead `proj-scitex-dev` owner.** Fixing
  the instructions while a write path kept re-creating the problem would have left the hole
  open: every card it imported landed under an owner that does not exist, so the real owner
  never saw it.

### Notes
- A regression test asserts zero dead-identity examples across the entire MCP surface
  (instructions + every registered tool description).
- Data half (applied to the live store, outside this release): 37 cards were stranded under
  dead `proj-*` scopes — 34 of them scitex-writer's, three still `blocked`, i.e. live work
  its owner could not see. Migrated after a dry-run and a backup; verified 0 dead scopes and
  0 dead owners remain. scitex-writer's visible slice went 21 → 55 cards, and its owner
  confirmed all five newly-visible blocked cards are real.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-11 — fix: the liveness nudges reached NOBODY; they now ride the inbox rail

### Fixed
- **The fleet-liveness sweep delivered to nobody.** v0.8.2 gave the sweep a scheduled
  caller — and it then ran every 30 minutes reaching zero agents. Verified against the
  live daemon:

      liveness sweep: ERR  scitex-todo    32 pending  wire=http  reason=transport-error
      liveness sweep: ERR  scitex-types    2 pending  wire=http  reason=no-turn-url-configured
      liveness sweep: ERR  scitex-writer   3 pending  wire=http  reason=no-turn-url-configured
      liveness sweep: # 0 pending-backlog push(es) sent

  Root cause: two delivery rails exist and the nudge used the wrong one. The digest
  (which works) enqueues into each recipient's pull-inbox; the nudge instead pushed over
  the HTTP turn-url rail, which is not provisioned for nearly any agent. Nudges now
  enqueue on the same inbox rail as the digest, using the same helpers and record shape,
  so agents' existing drain path picks them up with no change on their side.
- **A sweep that reaches nobody now SCREAMS.** When every attempted owner fails, the log
  emits `!! ALERT <kind>: 0 of N attempted nudge(s) delivered — this sweep reached
  NOBODY`. The old quiet `0 sent` is exactly what let a completely dead sweep ship and
  look healthy. An all-suppressed sweep does not cry wolf.
- Summary line now reports `detected / delivered (inbox) / suppressed / failed`.

### Changed
- `_push` (HTTP turn-url) is kept only as an opt-in secondary echo
  (`SCITEX_TODO_NUDGE_PUSH=1`). It never counts toward delivery, never arms suppression,
  and there is no silent fallback between rails in either direction.

### Notes
- Preserved from 0.8.2: deliver-on-change suppression (fingerprint = the set of stale card
  ids) with a 24h floor; only a DELIVERED nudge arms suppression; fail-soft per owner;
  suppressed owners still logged; `(unassigned)` surfaced but not delivered.
- Verified END-TO-END against the live fleet, not just in tests: after the fix, a
  `stale-active` nudge was delivered into a running agent's session through the inbox
  rail. That is the first time the fleet-liveness check has ever reached anyone.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-11 — fix: the fleet-liveness sweep actually runs, and nudges deliver on CHANGE

### Fixed
- **Nobody was checking whether agents were still working.** `sweep_and_nudge()`
  detects owners whose `in_progress` cards have gone untouched past a threshold
  and nudges that owner — but its only caller was the interactive `stats` CLI.
  It was pulled out of notifyd's loop when the store-lock convoy was fixed and
  never given another home, so in practice an idle agent was never nudged.
  notifyd now schedules the sweep on its own low cadence: outside the 60 s
  delivery path, detect-and-enqueue only, holding no store lock across it (a
  lock-holding sweep in that loop is what caused the convoy), and fail-soft, so
  a raising sweep can never kill delivery.
- **The sweep could not safely be scheduled as it stood.** `_deliver_per_owner()`
  pushed unconditionally — no fingerprint, no dedupe. With 30 owners currently
  stale, cronning it would have sent ~30 identical nudges every hour forever:
  the same desensitizing spam removed from the digest in 0.8.1. Nudges now
  deliver on CHANGE. Per `(owner, kind)` state persists `{fingerprint,
  delivered_at}`; the fingerprint is the *set* of stale card ids — order
  independent, and deliberately excluding wall-clock age, which would change
  every sweep and defeat suppression entirely.

### Added
- `SCITEX_TODO_NUDGE_FLOOR_HOURS` (default `24.0`) — an unchanged nudge is
  re-sent anyway once the floor elapses, so a genuinely stuck agent is still
  nudged daily. Mirrors the existing `SCITEX_TODO_DIGEST_FLOOR_HOURS`.

### Notes
- Only a **delivered** nudge arms the suppression; a failed push does not, so a
  broken delivery wire cannot silently mute an agent forever.
- Suppressed owners are still logged, so `stats` shows who was skipped and why.
  Silent suppression is how a sweep loses its readers' trust.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-11 — fix: the digest wakes an owner on CHANGE, not every sweep; `update --help` renders on click >= 8.2

### Fixed
- **Digest re-fired every sweep with an identical list.** Observed live: 30
  identical "Assigned-card digest #N" wake-ups in ~3 h — same cards, only the
  counter moving — and every agent got them. A signal that repeats unchanged
  every five minutes teaches its reader to ignore it, and the digest is the
  one signal that must stay un-ignorable. The owner's wake-up is now skipped
  while the card set AND each card's status are unchanged since the last
  DELIVERED digest, with a 24 h floor (`SCITEX_TODO_DIGEST_FLOOR_HOURS`) so a
  genuinely stuck owner is still nudged daily rather than never. A status flip
  alone (`in_progress` → `blocked`) re-notifies even when the id set is equal.
  The digest TICK still advances on the cadence: operator escalation fires
  after N ticks, so suppressing ticks would have silently disarmed
  high-priority escalation (the existing escalation test caught exactly that on
  the first cut). Only the owner-facing enqueue is conditional; escalation and
  creator-escalation are untouched, and a regression test pins it.
- **`scitex-todo update --help` crashed on click >= 8.2.** The custom
  `--blocker` param type's `get_metavar()` predated the `ctx` keyword click now
  passes, so the help screen died with a `TypeError` and the update syntax was
  undiscoverable (found by neurovista in production while working around a
  dropped MCP session).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-11 — feat: abolish `pending`; WIP gate counts work-in-flight only; deferred consumption pipeline; tolerant enum handling; board-UI batch

The fleet-incident release (2026-07-10 night): four operator-directed fixes
that each bit multiple agents in production, plus the board-UI review batch.

### Changed — status model
- `pending` is ABOLISHED. It is out of `VALID_STATUSES`; every default (CLI
  `--status`, MCP `add_task`, board create handler, `Task` dataclass) is now
  `deferred` — a new card carries a real decision. The CLI Choice and the
  board handlers reject `pending` at the boundary (HTTP 400 / usage error).
- `deferred` is NOT terminal (operator ruling: deferred は終了ではない). It is
  open backlog: it shows in active views, counts as open, and CAN be overdue
  when it carries a missed deadline. `close` writes `cancelled` (the real
  "closed as not planned" state) instead of overloading `deferred`.
- Tolerant enum handling on the SHARED store: an unknown status or a
  blocker-less `blocked` row WARNS loudly (naming the card and the likely
  version skew) instead of raising — on both read and write. One newer
  writer's row can no longer take every older reader's board down (the
  2026-07-10 fleet outage) or make every other agent's write fail.
  Structural corruption (missing id/title, duplicate id) still raises.

### Fixed — WIP gate counted backlog, not WIP
- The add gate excluded only `{done, goal}`, so `deferred`/`failed`/
  `cancelled` consumed budget forever; after the pending→deferred migration
  agents were refused at "88 open tasks" and could not even record incidents.
  Now `WIP_STATUSES = {in_progress}`; the gate fires only when the incoming
  card is itself `in_progress`. RECORDING (blocked/deferred/goal) is never
  gated. `OPEN_EXCLUDED_STATUSES` unifies the open predicate that previously
  existed in two drifted hand-copies.

### Added — deferred consumption pipeline (deferred is debt)
- `_backlog_triage`: recency-weighted pick-for-action sampling
  (Efraimidis–Spirakis, without replacement — fresh cards dominate; the
  backlog must not eat the agent), age-based expiry past 30 days (default
  outcome cancellation; the owner rescues what they still want), the
  `deferred_at` age clock (stamped once on entry, never reset by a re-defer)
  and the `last_triaged_at` re-draw cooldown.
- `scitex-todo triage [--mine|--agent X] [--json]` — the read-only payload a
  short-lived twin consumes under its parent's identity; mutation stays with
  the existing verbs.
- The 24 h backlog nudge, `runnable`, and `next` now target `deferred`
  (they still targeted the abolished `pending`, which no card carries — 379
  deferred cards were ageing in total silence).

### Added — store concurrency (lost-write incident)
- `edit_tasks(path)`: one locked read-modify-write cycle; writes nothing on
  exception. The sanctioned bulk-edit primitive.
- `save_tasks(..., expected_generation=store_generation(path))`: optimistic
  concurrency — a write based on a stale read raises `StaleStoreError`
  instead of silently erasing a concurrent writer's rows.
- `comment_task` stamps `last_activity` — a comment IS activity (cards under
  active discussion no longer read as abandoned).

### Added — board UI (operator live-review batch)
- Sticky-note Wall view with per-assignee islands and a derived next-up
  stack; brand-colored agent avatars; one-shot status-transition glow
  (compositor-only, with an SVG `drop-shadow` twin); uniform right-click on

## [0.7.50] - 2026-07-09 — feat: inbox reads/writes default to SQLite (retires the per-poll whole-store parse)

Fleet load incident: every agent's `scitex-todo mcp start` digest-poll (every
5 s) `safe_load`ed the entire ~9 MB task store just to read ONE recipient's
inbox — across ~21 agents the fleet's biggest CPU sink (host load ~27). This
moves the inbox read/write path onto SQLite so a poll is an indexed
`(recipient, seen)` lookup, never a whole-store parse.

- New `_inbox_sqlite` backend (stdlib `sqlite3`, WAL) at the constitution's
  runtime-DB path `<store_dir>/runtime/todo.db`. `enqueue` / `poll_inbox` /
  `ack` mirror the YAML contract exactly (dedup on `(event_type, card_id, ts,
  actor)`, `supersede`, `unseen_only`, `mark_seen`).
- SQLite is now the DEFAULT. `SCITEX_TODO_INBOX_BACKEND=yaml` is an explicit
  break-glass only; an unknown/unset value uses SQLite. No silent fallback — a
  SQLite error fails loud.
- Lazy one-time auto-migration: first access copies the YAML `inboxes:` records
  into the DB (guarded by a `migrated_from_yaml` meta flag), so no unseen
  notification is lost regardless of restart timing; steady state never reads
  YAML. Idempotent + reversible (the YAML section is never deleted).
- CLI: `scitex-todo inbox migrate-to-sqlite` / `inbox info`.

Phase 1 of the YAML→SQLite migration (inboxes only; cards/users/ledger stay on
YAML for now — Phase 2 covers cards). Complements the S0 shadow store (#349).

## [0.7.49] - 2026-07-08 — feat: S0 shadow SQLite DB + YAML bootstrap (YAML still canonical)

STAGE S0 of the YAML→SQLite migration (design-confirmed by scitex-dev,
RFC #348). Purely ADDITIVE: an authority-local SHADOW SQLite database is
created and bootstrapped FROM the current YAML store. The YAML (`tasks.yaml` +
the `threads.yaml` sidecar) STAYS the CANONICAL source of truth — no CRUD verb,
MCP tool, or `load_doc`/`_save_doc_unlocked` path reads or writes the DB in S0.
The shadow DB is incapable of harming the YAML by construction (a separate
file, never linked into any write path). S1 (dual-write) comes next.

- New `_db.py` adapter — stdlib `sqlite3` only (no scitex-db). `resolve_db_path`
  follows explicit arg → `$SCITEX_TODO_DB` → `local_state.user_path("todo",
  "todo.db")`, DELEGATING the user tier to the ecosystem resolver (never a
  re-rolled project/user precedence — the class of bug behind the 2026-07-06
  stale-store incident). On connect: WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`,
  `busy_timeout=300000`, `foreign_keys=ON`; schema stamped `user_version=1`.
- Schema: `tasks` (scalar Task fields as columns; `deadlines`/`_log_meta` as
  JSON TEXT; `group`→`grp`), `task_comments`, `task_edges`, `task_roles`,
  `users` + `user_names`, `notifications` (index `(recipient_id, seen)`),
  `messages` (folds the threads sidecar), `schema_meta`, plus the RFC's indexes.
- New `_db_bootstrap.py` — `import_from_yaml` reads the current YAML via the
  existing load path and rebuilds every table in one transaction. Idempotent
  (re-run = same state); opens the YAML READ-ONLY and never writes it back.
- New `db` CLI noun group: `db path`, `db verify`, `db import --from-yaml`.
- `repo` promoted to a first-class optional `Task` field + `tasks.repo` column
  (confirmed latent bug — used by add_task/list_tasks but absent from the
  dataclass; the ONE additive existing-code change allowed in S0).
- Adds `scitex_config` (foundational ecosystem lib) as a runtime dependency.

## [0.7.48] - 2026-07-08 — fix: guard the `print-stats` rollup, not just the push

The 0.7.47 single-instance guard (#346) did NOT stop the CPU stacking it was
meant to prevent. Verified live: two `*/10` notify runs still ran concurrently
at ~46% and ~30% CPU, and NO "prior run still holds the lock, skipping" log
fired. Root cause was **call-site placement**: in `_cli/_stats.py` the EXPENSIVE
work — the per-agent rollup that parses the ~9 MB `tasks.yaml` and aggregates
all ~930 cards — was computed ABOVE the flock guard (it was shared with the
plain-read `click.echo(out)` path). The `single_instance(...)` lock wrapped only
the push at the END. So two overlapping `--notify` ticks BOTH ran the costly
rollup concurrently (the observed CPU); the lock merely serialized the cheap
final push, giving zero CPU relief, and since neither tick blocked on the
other's rollup the "skipping" line never printed.

- **Lock BEFORE the rollup, in notify mode only.** In side-effecting/cron mode
  (`(notify or nudge_quiet) and by == "agent"`) `print-stats` now acquires the
  single-instance flock FIRST; if the lock is already held it logs the skip line
  and returns (exit 0) WITHOUT parsing the store at all. Only when the lock is
  confirmed acquired does the ENTIRE expensive path (store parse + rollup +
  notify/push) run — inside the lock. The plain read-only path (no `--notify`)
  computes its OWN rollup UNGUARDED and echoes the table, exactly as before, so
  interactive reads are never blocked or skipped. The rollup is factored into a
  `_rollup(...)` helper called from both branches; nothing expensive runs before
  the lock is confirmed in notify mode.
- **`_singleflight.single_instance` / `notify_lock_path` unchanged.** They were
  correct — only the CALL SITE was wrong. The lockfile still resolves to the
  same `<store>/runtime/print-stats-notify.lock` across invocations via
  `_paths.runtime_dir`, so two cron runs contend on one lock.
- **Regression test asserts ZERO store-loads when the lock is held.** The 0.7.47
  test only checked the push was skipped — which is why it missed the bug (the
  push is skipped either way). `test__print_stats_single_instance.py` now spies
  the real `_stats.load_tasks` (a call-counter wrapping the real parse, no mock)
  and asserts it is called ZERO times while the lock is held, that it DOES run
  when the lock is free, and that the unguarded plain-read parses even while the
  lock is held.
- **File split.** To keep both under the size budget, the `sync-github` verb
  moved to `_cli/_sync_github.py`; `_cli/_stats.py` keeps `print-stats` and still
  registers both. No behavior change to `sync-github`.

Incident: incident-todo-wake-watcher-interval2-spiral-20260708.

## [0.7.47] - 2026-07-08 — fix: single-instance flock on `print-stats --notify` (third store-size daemon)

The managed notify cron runs `scitex-todo print-stats --by agent --notify
--nudge-quiet` every 10 minutes. `print-stats --by agent` re-derives per-agent
rollups from all ~930 cards in the ~9 MB `tasks.yaml`; when a single run exceeds
the 10-min period it OVERLAPS the next cron tick, so runs STACK (observed: 2
concurrent at ~63% CPU each, heading toward the same saturation as the
wake-watcher spiral). This is the cron/one-shot analogue of the wake-watcher
death-spiral PR #344 fixed and the MCP inbox-drain spin #345 fixed — same
store-size root. The durable cure is archival (separate card); this is the
stacking guard.

- **Single-instance flock (`_singleflight.py`).** A new small, reusable module
  mirrors the wake-watcher's process-level lock (#344): a NON-BLOCKING
  `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on `<store>/runtime/print-stats-notify.lock`
  (resolved via `_paths.runtime_dir`, the same resolver the delivery ledger /
  pidfiles use). Exposed as a `single_instance(...)` context manager +
  `notify_lock_path(...)` helper so it is unit-testable.
- **Guard the notify path only.** `print-stats` takes the lock ONLY when
  `--notify` / `--nudge-quiet` is set (the cron/side-effect path). When the
  lock is already HELD (a prior run still going) the run LOGS a clear line and
  EXITS 0 — a skipped nudge tick is fine; the next tick runs. The lock releases
  on exit and automatically on process death, so a crashed run never wedges it.
- **Plain reads stay unguarded.** An interactive `print-stats` (no `--notify`)
  neither takes nor is blocked by the lock — it prints the table read-only and
  runs freely.

## [0.7.46] - 2026-07-08 — fix: mtime-gate the channel inbox drain (read-side twin of #344)

Each agent's `scitex-todo mcp start` runs a channel poll loop that called
`drain_once` every 5s **unconditionally**. Every drain calls `recipient_keys` +
`_inbox.poll_inbox`, both of which `safe_load` the ENTIRE shared store — the
inbox lives in an `inboxes:` section of the SAME ~9 MB / ~930-card `tasks.yaml`
as the cards. A ~9 MB parse every 5s per agent × ~7 channel servers on a host =
~350% sustained CPU (a major contributor to the load-25 baseline and the
conditions behind the recent wake-watcher saturation incident). This is the
READ/poll analogue of the every-tick reload spiral PR #344 fixed on the WRITE
side.

The cure mirrors #344's `WatcherState.mtime` short-circuit:

- **mtime gate (`_channel_drain_state.py`).** The inbox is only ever mutated
  through a store WRITE, so a new notification cannot appear without the store
  file's mtime advancing. Before any parse, a drain tick `os.stat`s the store
  and compares its mtime to the last drained tick; when UNCHANGED it SKIPS the
  whole drain (no `recipient_keys`, no `poll_inbox`, no parse) — an idle inbox
  now costs one `stat()` per 5s instead of a full re-parse. The store path is
  resolved the same way `_inbox.poll_inbox` resolves it
  (`resolve_tasks_path(store)` for `None`, else the explicit path) so the gate
  stats the EXACT file that would be parsed.
- **Fail-safe + first-tick.** The first tick always drains (seeds the mtime);
  an unresolvable / unstatable store path fails SAFE = drain, so correctness
  never regresses.
- **ack-write interaction.** A drain that pushes+acks WRITES the store (flipping
  records `seen`), bumping the mtime — the next tick drains once more, finds
  nothing new, records the post-ack mtime, and the tick after that skips. Net:
  exactly one extra parse after real activity, then a truly quiescent inbox
  idles at one `stat()` per tick.
- **Behavior preserved.** When the mtime DID change the drain is unchanged —
  recipient-key fan-out, unseen read, ack-after-push, `MAX_PUSH_PER_DRAIN` burst
  cap, and fail-soft all intact.

`_mcp_channel.py` was already over the 512-line file cap; the agent-identity
resolution (`resolve_agent_id` / `resolve_agent_id_optional`) was extracted to a
new `_channel_identity.py` (re-exported from `_mcp_channel` — no import breaks)
to land the change under budget.

## [0.7.45] - 2026-07-08 — fix: prevent the wake-watcher digest death-spiral

`scitex-todo.wake-watcher` (`watch --push --interval 2`, systemd
`Restart=on-failure`) death-spiraled on ywata-note-win 2026-07-08: the 2s
interval re-parsed the ~9 MB / ~930-card store faster than a tick finished on a
slow host, so the watch daemon ran at sustained high CPU while the separate
10-min `print-stats --by agent --notify` cron piled up unfinished digests on the
already-saturated box. Load hit 43 on 16 cores; sac-listen OOM-died and several
agents/builds died before the host was recovered
(incident-todo-wake-watcher-interval2-spiral-20260708).

Four durable, structural fixes to `_wake_watcher.py` / `_jobs_provider.py` /
`_cli/_loop.py`:

- **Interval floor + bump.** The wake-watcher JobSpec now uses `--interval 30`
  (was 2), the `watch` CLI default is 30s, and `clamp_interval()` enforces a
  **hard 10s floor** — any sub-floor value is clamped up with a loud WARNING
  naming the incident, so a stray `--interval 2` can never foot-gun the fleet
  again.
- **Single-instance lock.** `run_watcher_forever` takes a non-blocking `flock`
  on a runtime-dir lockfile; a second `watch` process sees the lock held and
  refuses to start, making two concurrent watchers (overlapping full-store
  re-parses) structurally impossible. The loop is strictly sequential, so a
  slow tick delays the next one — it can never launch an overlapping one.
- **Change-gated push + single parse.** After seeding, a tick whose store mtime
  is unchanged short-circuits before any parse (one `stat()`, no diff, no push)
  — a quiet board does no work per interval. When work is needed the store is
  parsed **once** per tick via `load_doc` (task list + `agents:` registry from
  the same `safe_load`), replacing the old double full-parse.
- **Self-throttle.** Push concurrency stays 1 and a slow tick degrades by
  delaying, never by stacking a second digest.

## [0.7.44] - 2026-07-08 — perf: cheapen the post-dump store-write verify without weakening the corruption guard (Fix B2)

The crash-safe store write (`_save_doc_unlocked`) reparsed the just-dumped tmp
with a FULL `safe_load` construct-reparse before promoting it — the 2026-06-13
corruption guard (lead a2a `d5809cd3`, the incident where the canonical file
ended mid-string). That full construct built ~159k Python objects on the live
9.2 MB / ~930-card store just to prove the bytes were parseable, and every
write paid it; bursts convoyed on the flock.

- New `src/scitex_todo/_store_verify.py` `_verify_dumped_tmp(tmp_path, dumped)`
  keeps the SAME guarantee (the promoted bytes must be FULLY reparseable) but
  drops the object construction. It does two cheap checks:
  1. **Byte-length check** — `os.stat(tmp).st_size == len(dumped.encode())`,
     catching a short / partial / disk-full write.
  2. **Event-scan reparse** — streams the tmp through the libyaml C parser
     (`yaml.parse(..., Loader=CSafeLoader)`) consuming events until a
     `StreamEndEvent` is observed. The C parser raises `yaml.YAMLError` on
     truncation / unterminated-scalar / malformed docs WITHOUT constructing the
     document objects; reaching StreamEnd proves the whole byte stream is
     well-formed end-to-end.
- `_save_doc_unlocked` now dumps to a STRING once (so the length check has the
  intended bytes and we never dump twice), writes it, fsyncs, then calls
  `_verify_dumped_tmp` before `os.replace`. Same crash-safe
  dump→tmp→fsync→verify→replace flow.
- The old reparsed-task-COUNT match is DROPPED: reaching `StreamEndEvent` proves
  the entire stream parsed, so a truncation that silently drops tasks aborts the
  parse before promotion — the event-scan supersedes the count check. Flagged
  in-code + here for scitex-dev review.
- Measured on a synthetic realistic-shape store: the event-scan verify is
  ~2.4x faster than the full `safe_load` construct-reparse it replaces
  (e.g. ~3.1 s → ~1.3 s on a ~900-card 1 MB doc; the saving scales with store
  size). New `tests/scitex_todo/test__store_verify.py` (10 tests) pins the
  corruption-safety non-negotiables; `test__store_doc_preservation.py` +
  `test__model.py` regression-green.

## [0.7.43] - 2026-07-08 — fix: collapse the notifyd digest replay-storm (supersede-on-enqueue)

A digest is a full point-in-time snapshot, but notifyd enqueued a fresh one
every tick without superseding prior unseen digests. A recipient whose channel
was down piled up dozens of stale digests that all replayed on reconnect (seen
live: one agent had 53 unseen `reminder` digests spanning 3 days).

- `_inbox.enqueue` gains a `supersede: bool = False` keyword. When `True`, every
  EXISTING unseen record matching both `event_type` AND `card_id` is removed
  before the new record is appended — at most ONE pending digest per recipient
  survives. Seen records (history) and the plain `(type,card,ts,actor)` dedup
  path are untouched.
- The reminder engine wires `supersede=True` ONLY at the cumulative owner-digest
  enqueue (`EVENT_DIGEST` / `(digest)`). Per-card events (escalation,
  creator_escalation) stay distinct and do NOT supersede.
- New maintenance verb `scitex-todo notifyd collapse-digests [--json]`
  (`_inbox_maint.collapse_digests`): one safe locked pass that collapses each
  recipient's unseen digest backlog to the single newest digest (older ones
  marked seen, nothing deleted) — clears the already-accumulated fleet backlog.
- Refactor: extracted the fail-soft dispatch helpers `_safe_resolve` /
  `_safe_enqueue` into `_reminder_enqueue.py` to keep `_reminders.py` within
  budget. Public API unchanged.

## [0.7.42] - 2026-07-08 — fix: tolerate a STALE deprecated env var when the current one is valid

Fleet agents still carry a stale ambient `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT` (the pre-0.7.30
name) baked in by an old sac injector. Until now scitex-todo fail-louded on the
mere PRESENCE of that old var — even when the current `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID` was
set and correct. In the unified MCP server that fail-loud was swallowed by
`resolve_agent_id_optional` → returned `None` → the digest poll loop never
started, so agents on 0.7.32 with a correct `AGENT_ID` connected (tools worked)
but never received channel notifications.

### Changed

- `resolve_agent_id` (`_mcp_channel.py`) now makes the CURRENT var WIN: when
  `arg` / `$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID` yields a valid id it is returned even if the
  stale `$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT` is also exported — a loud warning is logged and the
  stale var is ignored (no raise). The fail-loud on the old name fires ONLY when
  the current var is absent/invalid (a genuine reliance on the renamed-away
  var). Placeholder / unresolved errors are unchanged. `resolve_agent_id_optional`
  therefore returns the id (not `None`) when both vars are set, re-enabling the
  poll loop.
- Same tolerance applied to the store var in `_paths.py`: a stale
  `SCITEX_TODO_TASKS` is warn-and-ignored when `SCITEX_TODO_TASKS_YAML_SHARED`
  is set, and fails loud only when the current var is absent.

## [0.7.41] - 2026-07-07 — feat: operator↔agent direct-message chat view (/chat)

Minimal slice of the DM board pane (card
fleet-agent-direct-message-board-pane-20260707; scitex-dev DM convention
spec v1): the operator can message a specific agent from the phone via the
board, and agents reply through an MCP verb.

### Added

- **`scitex_todo._threads`** — pure DM thread store. Canonical record
  `{id, thread, from, to, body, ts, read}`; thread id `dm:<a>::<b>` with the
  peers sorted lexicographically (one thread per pair, both directions;
  reserved operator name `operator`). Threads live in a SIDECAR
  `<store_dir>/threads.yaml` next to the resolved `tasks.yaml` with its OWN
  flock, so chat writes never convoy with card writes; the write mirrors the
  crash-safe dump→tmp→fsync→reparse-verify→`os.replace` pattern of
  `_model._save_doc_unlocked`. API: `append_message` / `get_thread` /
  `list_threads` / `mark_read`.
- **dm-dispatch** — `append_message` also enqueues an `event_type="dm"`
  notification into the recipient's EXISTING pull-inbox
  (`_inbox.enqueue`, keyed via `_users.resolve_user` exactly like
  `poll_notifications`), so the ≥0.7.32 unified channel server pushes the
  message into the agent's live session. The `operator` recipient is
  enqueued too (symmetry; the board reads unread state from the sidecar).
  Fail-soft: an enqueue failure never loses the persisted thread record.
- **MCP verbs `dm_send(to, body)` / `dm_list(peer=None, ack=False)`** —
  agent-side reply + read surface (in `_mcp_skills`; `from` resolves via
  `resolve_agent_id_optional` with an actionable error when unset; store IO
  wrapped in `anyio.to_thread.run_sync`).
- **Board `/chat` view** — mobile-first page (new `chat.html` template +
  `static/scitex_todo/chat/chat.js`): collapsible agent list (users registry
  ∪ existing thread peers, unread badges), chronological bubble thread
  (operator right-aligned), compose box; polls `/dm/thread/<peer>` every 5s
  and `/dm/threads` every 10s. JSON endpoints `GET /dm/threads`,
  `GET/POST /dm/thread/<peer>` in `_django/handlers/dm.py` (distinct from
  the per-card `/chat/<card_id>` comment endpoint).

### Deferred (polish later)

- WebSocket push, markdown rendering, group threads, message search,
  CLI `dm` verbs, operator-side inbox drain.
## [0.7.40] - 2026-07-07 — feat: CLI verb-rename pilot (slice 6b) — `list-stale` / `find-card` / `watch-ci`

Pilot migration for the ecosystem CLI-standardization plan (doctrine:
scitex-dev `general/03_interface/02_cli`).

### Changed

- **`stale-list` → `list-stale`**, **`ci-watch` → `watch-ci`** (§1d grammar:
  compounds are kebab-case and VERB-FIRST), and **`resolve-card` →
  `find-card`** (it is a READ — prints ids of cards whose `repo` matches a
  filter — which is the doctrine `find` verb; `resolve` is also a banned
  synonym). The old names remain as HIDDEN warn-phase deprecated aliases:
  they forward all args/options to the canonical command, exit as it does,
  and print `'<old>' is deprecated — use '<new>' (removed in v0.9)` to
  stderr once per shell session. They disappear in v0.9 (three-phase
  ladder, §5).
- **Root `--help` is now categorized** under the fixed §4a headers (Core /
  Data & Sync / Service / Diagnostics / Introspection / Shell; the `Other`
  catch-all is empty), with spec-built help (`CliHelp`) on the root group
  and on `list-tasks` / `add` / `done` / `close` plus the renamed leaves.
- The `scitex-todo.ci-watch` JobSpec keeps its registry NAME (systemd/dedupe
  identity) but its command now invokes the canonical
  `scitex-todo watch-ci --once`.

### Added

- `src/scitex_todo/_cli/_compat.py` — guarded imports of scitex-dev's
  `deprecated_alias` + `help_spec` helpers (present on scitex-dev develop,
  absent from the released 0.21.0; scitex-python#352 precedent) with
  doctrine-contract fallbacks so warn+forward behavior is identical on
  every installed scitex-dev release.

### Refactored

- `_cli/_write.py` (pre-existing over the 512-line cap): the `update` verb
  moved to `_cli/_update.py` — pure move, one-verb-per-file precedent.

## [0.7.39] - 2026-07-07 — chore: channel-notification source label is now `stodo`

### Changed

- **Default `meta.source` label: `scitex-todo-system` → `stodo`.** Per the
  fleet naming agreement (operator 2026-07-07, card
  fleet-channel-source-sender-identity-naming-20260707), channel-notification
  source labels are standardized to SHORT sender-identity names — sac / cct /
  stodo (`daemon` is reserved for daemon-origin messages). This supersedes the
  short-lived `scitex-todo-system` default introduced in 0.7.32. Label-only
  change: `meta.source` is a free attribution label decoupled from routing
  (replies route via the MCP tool + ids).
- **Deployed config note:** `.mcp.json` entries that pin the old values
  (`--name scitex-todo` / `--name scitex-todo-system`, or
  `SCITEX_TODO_CHANNEL_SOURCE` set to either) should update to `stodo` or
  simply drop the override and inherit the new default.

## [0.7.34] - 2026-07-05 — fix: harden the channel push path (size cap + first-connect burst cap)

Hardens the `notifications/claude/channel` push surface against the crash class
behind the 2026-07-02 incident, where 180 solver apptainer containers died on
boot with `JSON message exceeded maximum buffer size of 1048576 bytes` — an
oversized scitex-todo channel push overflowed the Claude Agent SDK's 1 MB stdio
reader.

### Fixed

- **Oversized push body → SDK reader overflow.** `build_channel_params` now caps
  the pushed `content` body at `MAX_CONTENT_BYTES` (256 KiB, a quarter of the
  1 MB reader with generous headroom for `meta` + JSON framing). An oversized
  body is truncated on a UTF-8 char boundary (multibyte-safe) and gets a
  `[truncated — see card <id> on the board]` pointer so the full text stays
  reachable. `meta` values are additionally clamped (belt-and-suspenders).
- **First-connect burst.** `drain_once` now pushes at most `MAX_PUSH_PER_DRAIN`
  (50) records per call, across all recipient keys combined. A large unseen
  backlog can no longer flood the session in one tick — the remainder stays
  unseen and drains on the next ~5 s poll tick, a few dozen at a time. Acks
  still happen only for records actually pushed.

### Added

- New pure, unit-testable `scitex_todo._channel_guard` module holding the size
  constants and `_bounded_content` / `_bounded_meta_value` helpers (keeps
  `_mcp_channel.py` within the module size budget).

### Docs

- Documented the headless lever: with **no** `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID` the unified
  `scitex-todo mcp start` runs tools-only (no poll loop, zero pushes) — the
  intended mode for solver / headless capsules that must not receive pushes.

## [0.7.33] - 2026-07-05 — feat: package-level `health` doctor (MCP tool + CLI verb)

A broad store / identity / delivery health check, exposed as BOTH the `health`
MCP tool and the `scitex-todo health` CLI verb. Motivated by the 0.7.32
handshake incident: the `channel_drain` check turns that class of "MCP not
connected" failure into a one-command diagnosis.

### Added

- **`scitex_todo._health.health(...)`** — one pure, never-raising function that
  returns the cross-package standard report shape
  `{"package", "ok", "checks":[{name,ok,detail,hint}], "summary"}` (shared
  verbatim with the sac/cct health tools). Every FAILING check carries an
  actionable `hint`; a check that errors internally is reported as `ok=false`
  with the error in its hint rather than raising. Checks: `store_canonical`
  (resolved store is the canonical user/shared path — not a project shadow —
  and is readable, writable, and parses with a top-level `tasks` key),
  `agent_id` (`$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID` resolves to a real value, not
  blank/`unknown`/an unexpanded `$VAR`), `notifyd_alive` (real pidfile probe of
  the delivery daemon), `channel_drain` (this agent's unseen vs seen inbox
  backlog — flags a large unseen pile that was never drained), and
  `channel_capable` (`scitex_todo._mcp_channel` imports and exposes
  `_serve`/`_run`).
- **`health` MCP tool** — registered on the shared FastMCP instance
  (`scitex_todo._mcp_skills`); returns the JSON report. Distinct from the
  narrow `mcp doctor` (which only checks the fastmcp install).
- **`scitex-todo health [--json]` CLI verb** — human-readable report by default,
  raw JSON with `--json`; exits `0` when all checks pass, else `1` (usable as a
  shell/CI gate).

## [0.7.32] - 2026-07-04 — fix: channel poll loop no longer starves the MCP handshake

Hotfix for a fleet-wide "scitex-todo MCP not connected" regression introduced
by the unified server (0.7.31).

### Fixed

- **Unified `mcp start` failed the MCP `initialize` handshake once an agent had
  an identity set** — every fleet agent showed the `scitex-todo` server as "not
  connected". Root cause: the inbox poll loop's first drain ran SYNCHRONOUS
  blocking store IO (`recipient_keys` + `_inbox.poll_inbox`, which lock and
  parse the whole YAML store) **inline on the asyncio event loop**. That starved
  the `ServerSession` so it never answered `initialize` before the client timed
  out. The stall scaled with inbox size, so it surfaced once an inbox reached
  ~600 entries. `drain_once` now off-loads every blocking store call to a worker
  thread (`anyio.to_thread.run_sync`); only the push itself runs on the loop, so
  the handshake (and tool calls) are never blocked. Both tools AND digest push
  are preserved. Regression tests pin the invariant (drain yields before it
  touches the store) and the end-to-end handshake with an active poll loop.

### Changed

- **Channel render name is now `scitex-todo-system`** (was `scitex-todo`). The
  system-pushed notification source (`meta.source`, env
  `SCITEX_TODO_CHANNEL_SOURCE`, default) is deliberately distinct from the
  `scitex-todo` agent id so the operator's TUI does not confuse a system digest
  with a message authored by the scitex-todo agent. Deployed `.mcp.json` entries
  that pin `SCITEX_TODO_CHANNEL_SOURCE=scitex-todo` must update to
  `scitex-todo-system` (or drop the key to take the new default).

## [0.7.31] - 2026-07-03 — one unified scitex-todo MCP server (tools + digest push)

The turn-on release for fleet-wide notifications. Together with the 0.7.30
env-var standardization, this is what the coordinated fleet flip deploys.

### Changed

- **One MCP server instead of two**: `scitex-todo mcp start` now runs a SINGLE
  server that both serves the card tools AND pushes this agent's digest
  (`notifications/claude/channel`). Previously the tools server (`mcp start`)
  and the digest-push server (`mcp channel`) were separate, needing two
  `.mcp.json` entries. Now one `scitex-todo` entry (`args: ["mcp", "start"]`)
  does both — matching the one-server-per-project convention.
  - It reuses FastMCP's underlying low-level server (which has every registered
    tool) and declares the `claude/channel` capability alongside the tools
    capability, so no tool behaviour changes.
  - The agent id is optional: with `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID` set, the digest is
    pushed; without it, the server serves tools only (a loud warning, never a
    hard failure on the tools surface).
  - `--http` transport remains tools-only (HTTP cannot carry the push).
  - The standalone `scitex-todo mcp channel` verb is retained for
    back-compatibility.

## [0.7.30] - 2026-07-02 — env-var standardization for fleet-wide notification delivery

Enables the per-agent channel-drain server to be wired fleet-wide (each agent
receives its own periodic digests + action-hooked card notifications), the
crucial rail for task-driven fleet coordination. Coordinated with the container
layer: the env-injection + `.mcp.json` wiring flip in lockstep with this release.

### Changed

- **Env var rename**: the agent-identity var `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT` is renamed to
  `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID` (encodes that it is an identity). It stamps
  `created_by`/`updated_by`, keys the channel inbox, and drives the `--mine`
  filter.
- **Env var rename**: the task-store override `SCITEX_TODO_TASKS` is renamed to
  `SCITEX_TODO_TASKS_YAML_SHARED` (encodes the shared-yaml store).
- **Channel server is fully env-configurable**: `scitex-todo mcp channel` now
  reads `SCITEX_TODO_CHANNEL_SOURCE` (meta.source, default `scitex-todo`) and
  `SCITEX_TODO_CHANNEL_INTERVAL` (poll seconds, default `5`), with CLI flags as
  optional overrides. The `.mcp.json` entry needs zero config args — every
  parameter is a `SCITEX_TODO_`-prefixed env var.

### Fixed

- **Fail-loud on the deprecated env-var names**: if `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT` or
  `SCITEX_TODO_TASKS` is still set, resolution raises with an actionable
  "renamed to …; unset the old var" message instead of silently honouring a
  stale export that could pin the wrong identity or store.

## [0.7.29] - 2026-07-02 — standalone user-delivery rail, notify/reminder engine, user registry + identity, and the release-pipeline fix

First successful PyPI publish since 0.7.10 — the release pipeline had been
broken (see Fixed below), so the accumulated work below shipped only now.

### Added

- **Standalone user-delivery rail**: scitex-todo's own notification path —
  channels + a delivery ledger + an always-on `notifyd` daemon (with a systemd
  unit) + a standalone MCP channel-notification server. Users-first, with no
  dependency on scitex-agent-container.
- **Notify / reminder engine**: nag-until-closed reminders with per-owner
  digest cadence, an owner allowlist for phased rollout, operator escalation
  for high-priority stale cards, and liveness-triggered escalation to the card
  creator when an assignee is unreachable.
- **User registry + canonical identity resolver**: collapses owner naming
  drift (host@name aliases) so notifications resolve to the right inbox;
  assignee liveness surfaced at assign time.
- **Model**: `cancelled` status (closed-as-not-planned terminal state).
- **Idle-guard Stop-hook**: blocks going idle while in-progress work is
  abandoned.
- **Fleet payload**: surfaces the waiting-on-operator queue (ids + SSOT count).

### Changed

- **Standalone decoupling from scitex-agent-container**: removed the sac
  listen-daemon HTTP fallback for turn URLs (zero runtime sac coupling) and
  reworded sibling-system names out of standalone-claim docstrings.
- **Store performance**: replaced the ruamel round-trip writer with a fast
  C-backed safe dump; config + reminders sidecar reads use the fast loader.
- **Board runtime state** now lives under `<store>/runtime/`.
- **Board v3 UX**: bigger timeline scatters with marquee select + Ctrl/Cmd+C
  copy + right-click menu; tighter left gutter; timeline edge legend on hover.
- **CI**: pytest-matrix serialized so one PR can't saturate all three runners.

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline**: the `publish` job declared `permissions: id-token: write`
  only, which defaults every other scope (including `contents`) to `none`, so
  `actions/checkout` could not clone the private repo ("Repository not found").
  Added `contents: read`. This had broken every tagged release since 0.7.10.
- **Fail-loud on unresolved actor/author** at task creation (no `getuser`
  fallback); board create-form requires creator/assignee.
- **Multi-select toolbar** no longer stretches to full column height.
- **Reminders**: parked-blocked cards excluded from the per-owner nag digest;
  store resolved before the notifyd reminder sweep.
- **Channel delivery**: drains producer-matching keys (raw name + resolved
  user-id); mutation store threaded into card-event emit so notifications
  actually enqueue.
- **Board**: falls back to the port-found board when the pidfile is stale.

## [0.7.28] - 2026-06-26 — board UX (timeline beeswarm/anti-flash, marker copy, user roles) + CI off paid runners

### Added

- **Timeline marker multi-select + copy + right-click menu** (`timelineSelect.js`):
  click markers to select, right-click for a menu, copy selected cards' contents
  to the clipboard.
- **Card detail user roles**: the detail drawer shows Creator / Assignee /
  Collaborators / Subscribers in user vocabulary; a `created_by` field is now
  captured at task creation (CLI `--created-by` + MCP), back-compatible with
  legacy rows; the `/graph` node payload emits `created_by` / `collaborators` /
  `subscribers`.
- **`help-wait` / `help-clear`** verbs + MCP tools (also in 0.7.27) — the SSOT
  card primitive the agent-waiting escalation hook calls.

### Changed

- **Timeline no longer flashes / jumps to top**: the raster skips its rebuild
  when the `/timeline` payload is unchanged and preserves scroll position; the
  main board likewise skips redraw on unchanged `/graph` and keeps scroll.
- **Comment posting is non-blocking + fail-loud**: the in-request agent relay
  uses a short (2s) timeout instead of 30s and surfaces a loud toast on a
  notify failure (comment is still saved).
- **CI moved off GitHub paid runners**: `cla.yml` + `auto-merge-to-develop.yaml`
  now run on self-hosted Spartan (auto-merge's `gh` calls rewritten as `curl`
  REST since Spartan has no `gh`); `newb-docs-quality` disabled (docker-only,
  pending apptainer). No workflow uses `ubuntu-latest`.

### Fixed

- **Fleet-adapter tests** skip (not fail) when `sac` is absent/non-functional,
  so a broken optional dependency can't red-gate CI (also in 0.7.27).

## [0.7.27] - 2026-06-25 — Timeline beeswarm + `help-wait` verb + sac-decoupled CI

### Added

- **Timeline beeswarm y-packing** (PR #245). In the board_v3 Timeline raster,
  time-overlapping markers in a lane used to render at the same vertical
  center and occlude each other. A deterministic sub-row packer
  (`timelinePack.js::packRows` — greedy interval partitioning, capped at
  `MAX_ROWS`) now fans co-located markers into stacked sub-rows and grows the
  lane to fit, so every task is visible. x/time math and the time-axis are
  unchanged.
- **`scitex-todo help-wait` / `help-clear`** CLI verbs + `help_wait` /
  `help_clear` MCP tools (PR #242). First-class "an agent is waiting on the
  operator" card semantics (`help-<agent>-waiting`, `status=blocked`,
  `blocker=operator-decision`), idempotent atomic upsert / resolve. Lifts the
  card shape out of the dotfiles Notification hook so scitex-todo owns the
  single source of truth; the hook becomes a thin trigger that calls the verb.

### Changed

- **Fleet-adapter tests decoupled from the live `sac` binary** (PR #244). The
  happy-path hosts tests now SKIP (not FAIL) when `sac` is absent or
  non-functional, via a shared probe guard — so a broken/missing optional
  fleet dependency can never red-gate the standalone package's CI. Fail-loud
  adapter-error tests still run (they need no working sac).

## [0.7.25] - 2026-06-15 — `scitex-todo ci-watch` (record-only CI poller)

### Added

- **`scitex-todo ci-watch`** + **`scitex-todo.ci-watch` cron JobSpec**
  (PR #206, lead a2a `b4c10158` / operator decoupled-pollers override
  via dev a2a `96afacc7`). Record-only CI poller — server-side
  `*/5 * * * *` cron that sweeps every repo in
  `dashboard.yaml → fleet.ci_status.repos` (or env override
  `SCITEX_TODO_FLEET_CI_REPOS=owner/a,owner/b`), diffs against the
  local state cache at `~/.scitex/todo/ci-state.json` (override via
  `SCITEX_TODO_CI_STATE`), classifies the transition
  (`first-seen` / `newly-green` / `newly-red` / `still-pending` /
  `unchanged`), and logs one stderr line per repo.

  Lane: **todo records, SAC delivers** — todo writes no a2a sends
  and emits no bus events; SAC has its own independent poller for the
  delivery side. Either side can crash without breaking the other.
  The dedupe key (`head_sha`, `overall`) is content-keyed so SAC's
  poller can run at a different cadence (10 / 15 / 30 min) without
  breaking parity.

  CLI:

      scitex-todo ci-watch --once                # cron mode (one sweep)
      scitex-todo ci-watch --interval 600        # loop with custom cadence
      scitex-todo ci-watch --once --dry-run      # plan + summary, no state write
      SCITEX_TODO_FLEET_CI_REPOS=owner/a scitex-todo ci-watch --once

  Wired into the ecosystem federation via `_jobs_provider.py`; after
  `scitex-dev ecosystem up`, the `scitex-todo.ci-watch.timer`
  systemd-user unit fires every 5 min. 18 mock-free tests
  (classifier purity, state load/save round-trip + atomic-write, CLI
  dry-run, JobSpec registration).

## [0.7.24] - 2026-06-14 — `scitex-todo mcp install-fleet` (P3a one-liner)

### Added

- **`scitex-todo mcp install-fleet --agents-dir <DIR>`** (PR #204,
  lead a2a `1ab212f3`). One-shot fleet sweep — walks every
  ``<agents-dir>/*/to_home/.mcp.json`` (the agent-container spec
  convention) and idempotently applies the scitex-todo MCP entry to
  each. Sibling MCP server entries preserved; per-agent corrupt JSON
  reported + sweep continues; final summary line carries
  ``agents=N updated=K noop=M errors=E``. Closes the missing-MCP gap
  that ripple-wm hit (had to a2a-relay through me for card add
  because their container's `.mcp.json` was bare). 12 mock-free
  CliRunner tests.

  Sweep one-liner for agent-container:

      scitex-todo mcp install-fleet \\
          --agents-dir ~/.dotfiles/src/.scitex/agent-container/agents \\
          --env-tasks-path /home/agent/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml -y

  Mirrors the single-file ``install --apply`` semantics (PR #155 +
  #158) — same backup, same idempotency, same env-pin.

## [0.7.23] - 2026-06-14 — Board v3: time-based view (sort + group by time)

### Added

- **Sort by time + Group by time on the v3 board** (PR #201
  cherry-picked via #202; lead a2a `ff1441d7`, operator request
  「時間でのビュー」). The v3 board at `/` (the operator's home view)
  now exposes time-based controls in the existing
  `.stx-todo-filterbar__group--view` group:
  - Sort dropdown extends with `created_at` + `completed_at` options
    (newest first) plus the reworked `last_activity` comparator.
  - New "Group by time" checkbox (`#stx-toggle-group-by-time`) folds
    each project column's cards under collapsible bucket headers:
    TODAY / THIS WEEK / THIS MONTH / OLDER. State persists in
    localStorage (`scitex-todo:group-by-time`,
    `scitex-todo:time-buckets-collapsed`).
  - New `board_v3/08-time-grouping.css` with token-only styling
    (bucket headers, chevrons, collapsed state, body left-rail).
  - 43 mock-free test cases pin the bucket classifier + sort-key
    helper + CSS contract.

  The existing Time View raster (PR #186) on `/legacy/` is
  untouched — this is a complementary control on the v3 board so
  the operator can sort/group by time WITHOUT switching to the
  React-SPA route.

### Notes for ops

PR #201 originally landed on `main` (subagent missed `--base develop`).
#202 cherry-picked the change onto develop and re-fixed the multi-line
Django comment that the cherry-pick re-introduced (regression caught
by `test__no_multiline_django_short_comments.py` from PR #199).

## [0.7.22] - 2026-06-14 — Hotfix: operator-visible Django template comment leak

### Fixed

- **board_v3 template comment leaked as literal text** (PR #199,
  lead a2a `f7a5d37930b9479ca7e53a7e316c132d`). Django's
  ``{# … #}`` syntax is single-line only — newlines between ``{#``
  and ``#}`` are NOT stripped, so the multi-line block at
  ``board_v3.html:200-208`` (introduced in PR #173) rendered as
  visible text on the board UI. Converted to
  ``{% comment %}…{% endcomment %}`` (multi-line safe). New
  regression test (``tests/scitex_todo/_django/test__no_multiline_django_short_comments.py``)
  walks every ``.html`` under ``_django/templates/`` and asserts
  every ``{#`` closes with ``#}`` on the same line — bug class
  pinned. Operator reported live; hotfix-released same hour.

## [0.7.21] - 2026-06-14 — Hook bus: ordering + card-message feedback channel

Two enhancements that close the **operator↔card↔owner+collaborators
feedback ring** Phase 6 was missing. Cross-package coordination via
the existing `scitex_todo.hooks` entry-point bus — no new poller, no
inter-package import.

### Added

- **Handler ordering primitives** (PR #196). Two optional function
  attributes on hooks-bus handlers:
  - `on_event.priority = <int>` (default 100; LOWER runs FIRST).
  - `on_event.critical = True` (default False; if True and the
    handler raises, dispatcher aborts the chain and re-raises so the
    producer's HTTP/CLI wrapper translates to 500 / non-zero exit).
  Sort key is `(priority asc, entry-point-name asc)` — stable.
  Mutation visible by reference (early handlers' mutations land for
  late handlers). Plugin LOAD failures (ImportError on `ep.load()`)
  logged as `"load: <msg>"` in `plugin_errors`; chain continues.
  Each error entry now carries `priority` + `critical` metadata so
  the producer can see the failure context. 11 mock-free tests.
  Designed with dev for the ci-result chain (owner-map priority=10
  critical=True before SAC's delivery at priority=200).
- **`card-message` event kind** (PR #197). Every comment landing on
  a card via `_store.comment_task` fans out a `card-message` event
  on the bus. Payload: `{kind, card_id, body, author, owner,
  collaborators, created_at}`. Owner resolution falls back
  `card.agent → card.assignee → null`. Collaborators is the
  pre-append snapshot of distinct comment authors, deduped,
  EXCLUDING owner AND new author (SAC must not echo). Emit happens
  OUTSIDE the file-lock so slow handlers can't starve writers; bus
  errors are caught + logged so external handler failure (SAC
  unreachable, missing entry-point) never breaks the producer's
  comment-save. 15 mock-free tests.
  Surfaces emit: `/chat/<card_id>` POST, `scitex-todo comment` CLI,
  MCP `comment_task` tool, Python API direct calls.

### Provenance

PR #196 + #197. Lead a2a `0ab1d9fd` (ci-result ordering coordination
with dev) + `1e8e33d0` (card-message feedback channel — Phase 6
extends to active routing). Both follow the same loose-coupling
pattern: todo = producer, SAC = consumer, no cross-package import.

## [0.7.20] - 2026-06-14 — 🎯 TRACK 2 dashboard mission COMPLETE (6/6 surfaces)

Closes the operator-mandated fleet-dashboard mission. The board at
:8051 is now the ONE screen the operator watches: tasks (existing)
+ CI status + host geometry + agent mesh + ACL + timing telemetry
+ chat. All six surfaces honor the same architectural principles:
fail-loud / registry-sourced / no hardcoded proper nouns / no mocks.

### Added

- **Phase 6 — Chat surface** (PR #194). Operator↔agent thread view
  over the existing per-card `comments[]` substrate. New
  `_django/handlers/chat.py` with `GET /chat/<card_id>` (returns
  comments + title) and `POST /chat/<card_id>` (validates
  non-empty text, calls `_store.comment_task`, returns the appended
  comment). 404 on unknown card_id; 400 on empty text; 405 on
  PUT/DELETE. New `ChatPanel.tsx` mounts inside the existing
  NodeDetailPanel drawer — bubble layout with author-color hash,
  30s auto-poll for new comments, fail-loud error pill + toast on
  write failure. Author default from `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT` env. 45
  new mock-free tests (16 backend + 8 JS predicate + 21 CSS/wiring).
  TODOs: RW-perm gating, WebSocket push, markdown rendering,
  @-mentions / threading / reactions / attachments.

### Mission complete — 6/6 TRACK-2 surfaces

| # | Surface              | PR    | Adapter source                          |
|---|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | CI status pills      | #178  | `gh api repos/.../check-runs`            |
| 2 | Host geometry        | #185  | `sac host list --json`                   |
| 3 | Agent mesh + ACL     | #189  | `sac a2a list --json` + `... grants`     |
| 4 | Timing backend       | #191  | card `_log_meta` timestamps              |
| 5 | Timing chart UI      | #192  | `/fleet/timing`                          |
| 6 | Chat surface         | #194  | per-card `comments[]`                    |

The board reads from authoritative registries; it never duplicates
state. Every adapter raises `FleetAdapterError` on missing data;
the UI surfaces a visible error state instead of silently degrading.

### Provenance

PR #194. Lead a2a `74db4f2d` + `10afa799` (vision); operator's
"one screen, watch the whole fleet, self-improvement" intent
realized end-to-end.

## [0.7.19] - 2026-06-14 — Phase 4 + 5: timing telemetry (backend + chart UI)

5 / 6 TRACK-2 dashboard surfaces shipped. Last remaining: Phase 6
chat. Operator's "record what took how long → self-improvement"
intent now visible end-to-end on the board.

### Added

- **Phase 4 — Timing telemetry backend** (PR #191). New
  `_django/handlers/fleet/timing.py`: pure
  `compute_timing(tasks, *, window_days=30)` derives three durations
  per task (`created_to_started` / `started_to_done` /
  `created_to_done`) from existing card timestamps (no state
  duplication), then aggregates per agent / project / group with
  median + p95 + median-queue. `_django/handlers/fleet/timing_view.py`
  exposes `GET /fleet/timing?window_days=N` (200 OK; 405 on POST;
  500 on store-read failure — fail-loud). `<ungrouped>` sentinel for
  null groups; `n_tasks_missing_timestamps` diagnostic surfaces
  done cards with broken `_log_meta`. 23 mock-free tests (16 pure +
  7 view). Phase 4.b gaps flagged inline: a2a-log scraping for
  per-turn agent durations, histograms / CDF arrays, p50/p75/p99
  knobs.
- **Phase 5 — Timing chart UI** (PR #192). New
  `FleetTimingPanel.tsx`: collapsed `📊 timing` pill in the STATUS
  toolbar group; click to expand. WINDOW (7d/30d/90d) + GROUP-BY
  (Agent/Project/Group) controls + inline SVG bar chart, one row
  per key with median + p95 bars. Sort by p95 desc so the
  bottleneck rides at the top. Tooltip carries `n_tasks_done` +
  `median_queue_s`. Footer carries `n_tasks_in_window` +
  `n_tasks_missing_timestamps`. 60s poll. Fail-loud on adapter
  error. 17 mock-free CSS/helper tests.

### Provenance

PR #191 + #192. Lead a2a `74db4f2d` + `10afa799`. Subagent execution
on both phases; Phase 5 subagent terminated mid-flight + the parent
agent finished the commit/push/PR.

## [0.7.18] - 2026-06-14 — Phase 3: agent mesh + ACL graph

### Added

- **Phase 3 — Agent mesh + ACL graph** (PR #189). New
  `_django/handlers/fleet/sac_mesh.py` adapter reads `sac a2a list
  --json` (peer registry) + `sac a2a grants --json` (comms_grants
  ACL). New `/fleet/mesh` Django endpoint. New `FleetMeshPanel.tsx`
  with an inline-SVG radial graph: nodes = agents, edges = grants,
  allow=`--status-success` green, deny=`--status-error` muted red.
  Mounted in the toolbar STATUS group. 26 new mock-free tests (10
  adapter + 4 view + 12 FE CSS/helper) + 119-test broader fleet
  suite green.
- **Phase 3.b TODOs captured inline** (will land in a follow-up):
  - `comms_blocks` has no listing CLI yet → deny edges not wired
    (the shape already supports `allow: false`).
  - No heartbeat-freshness threshold in `sac a2a list` → status is
    `online` / `unknown`, never `offline`.
  - `state.db` path not surfaced → `config_path` returns null.

### Provenance

PR #189. Lead a2a `74db4f2d`. 3/6 TRACK-2 dashboard surfaces shipped
(CI / hosts / mesh). Remaining: timing telemetry + chat surface.

## [0.7.17] - 2026-06-14 — Hook-consumer contract + Time View + Phase 2 hosts

Wave 2 of the fleet-dashboard mission. The hook-consumer contract
is the operator-mandated "green static record pipe" — SAC's
push-hook + dev's merge-Action will call scitex-todo's API to
auto-record progress/DONE on the board.

### Added — Hook-consumer (loose-coupling contract)

- **`scitex_todo.hooks` entry-point group** (PR #187, lead a2a
  `6fff33d6` + `fbffb879`, operator-mandated). External producers
  register a plugin callable under this group:
  `def on_event(event: dict) -> None`.
- **Three converging wire surfaces** (producers pick one):
  - **HTTP**: `POST /hooks/push`, `POST /hooks/done`. Idempotent.
    405 on GET, 400 on bad shape / kind-mismatch.
  - **CLI**: `scitex-todo hook push --payload <FILE|->` /
    `scitex-todo hook done --payload <FILE|->`.
  - **Python**: `from scitex_todo._hooks import dispatch_event`.
- **Canonical event payloads**:
  - push: `{kind, repo, branch, commit_sha, author?, message?,
    card_ids?}`
  - done: `{kind, repo, pr_number, pr_url, author?, merged_at?,
    card_ids?}`
- **Built-in handlers run BEFORE plugins**:
  - push → idempotent comment-append (dedupe via full commit_sha
    substring match).
  - done → idempotent `pr_url` stamp + `status=done` flip (noop if
    already done with matching pr_url).
- **Plugin failures are caught + logged** — one bad plugin can NOT
  silently break the board's own record-keeping.
- 29 mock-free tests (validator fail-loud + handler idempotency +
  HTTP contract).

### Added — Dashboard surfaces

- **Time View** (PR #186, operator-direct via lead a2a `d0f7a0e3`).
  Live SVG raster timeline as the 5th LAYOUT toggle. Horizontal
  axis = TIME (1h/6h/24h/7d window); lanes by agent OR group; bars
  fade-out on done; depends_on/blocks edges drawn as connecting
  lines; click-through to the existing NodeDetailPanel. 30s poll.
  17 backend + 15 frontend mock-free tests. Pan/zoom/WebSocket are
  flagged TODOs for future iterations.
- **Phase 2 — Host geometry** (PR #185, lead a2a `74db4f2d` +
  `10afa799`). `sac host list --json` adapter + `/fleet/hosts`
  endpoint + `FleetHostsPanel.tsx` mounted next to the CI pills.
  Fail-loud on missing `sac` CLI (FleetAdapterError → HTTP 500).
  Phase 2.b cpu/mem/SLURM enrichment landing site marked with
  `TODO(phase-2.b)`. 14 + 47 = 61 tests green.

### Provenance

## [0.7.16] - 2026-06-14 — TRACK 1 COMPLETE: parallelism-engine dispatch backbone

Completes the **dependency-aware ticket** track the operator/lead
vision (a2a `74db4f2d` + `10afa799`) named as the parallelism
engine. Combined with the v0.7.15 TRACK-2 Phase-1 CI pills, this
release closes Wave 1 of the fleet-dashboard mission.

### Added — TRACK 1 (parallelism-engine backbone)

- **T1.2 — `runnable_tasks()` API + `scitex-todo runnable` CLI**
  (PR #181). Batch runnable view (sister to `next_task`'s single
  pick) respecting `depends_on` + reverse-`blocks` closure +
  optional agent + group filter. Diagnostic counts
  (`candidate_count`, `blocked_by_deps_count`) let the dispatcher
  distinguish "queue empty" from "queue blocked." 22 mock-free
  tests.
- **T1.3 — `blocked_tasks()` inverse view + `scitex-todo blocked`
  CLI** (PR #182). For every NOT-runnable task, name WHY
  (`explicit-blocker` / `manual-block` / `depends-on` /
  `reverse-blocks`) + the chain of upstream ids. `by_reason`
  histogram for observability. 20 mock-free tests.
- **T1.4 — `/runnable` + `/blocked-batch` Django endpoints**
  (PR #183). JSON HTTP twins of the CLI verbs so the dispatcher
  consumes the data over HTTP. POST returns 405; fail-loud on
  load_tasks errors. 12 mock-free RequestFactory tests.

TRACK 1 wave list:
- T1.1 #179 (group field, in v0.7.15)
- T1.2 #181 (runnable API + CLI)
- T1.3 #182 (blocked inverse + CLI)
- T1.4 #183 (HTTP endpoints)

The lead-side dispatcher can now drive parallel work across agents
and groups end-to-end via either CLI or HTTP.

### Provenance

PR #181 + #182 + #183. Lead a2a `74db4f2d`. TRACK 2 (fleet
dashboard) continues in parallel — Phase 2 host geometry queued.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-06-14 — Fleet-dashboard Phase 1 (CI pills) + TRACK-1 `group` field

Operator vision (lead a2a `74db4f2d` + `10afa799`): scitex-todo
becomes the ONE fleet dashboard + dependency-aware ticket backbone.
This is wave 1 of two parallel tracks.

### Added — TRACK 2 (Fleet Dashboard)

- **Phase 1 — CI-status pills + Phase-0 registry-reader harness**
  (PR #178). New `_django/handlers/fleet/` package: `FleetAdapterError`
  (fail-loud on missing data, no silent fallback), `fleet_config_load`
  (reads `~/.scitex/todo/dashboard.yaml` or env
  `SCITEX_TODO_FLEET_CI_REPOS=owner/name,...`; NO hardcoded slugs),
  `gh_ci.fetch_repo_ci_status` (`gh repo view` for default branch +
  `gh api .../check-runs`). New `/fleet/ci-status` Django endpoint
  with per-repo error trap (200 with `error` field per bad repo, 500
  on malformed config). Front-end `FleetCiPills.tsx` polls every 30s,
  per-repo green/red/amber/grey pill bound to scitex-ui status
  tokens. 33 fleet tests + full 277-task Django suite green. Pattern
  established for Phases 2-6 (hosts / mesh / timing / chart / chat).

### Added — TRACK 1 (Parallelism-engine backbone)

- **T1.1 — `group` field on Task** (PR #179, lead a2a `74db4f2d`).
  Optional `group: str | None` on the Task dataclass. The
  parallelism-engine dispatcher will ask
  `runnable(group=<G>)` so independent (dep-free) tasks within a
  group run concurrently per the operator's model. Free-form
  non-empty string; absent = ungrouped. Validator extends the
  existing scope/assignee non-empty-string loop. New `--group` CLI
  flag on `add` + `update` (empty string clears). Distinct from
  `_groups.py:Group` (project-cluster viewer aggregation). 15
  mock-free tests pin the dataclass shape, validator, Python API,
  and CLI wiring. Follow-up chain: T1.2 (`runnable()` API + CLI),
  T1.3 (`scitex-todo blocked` introspection), T1.4 (`/runnable` +
  `/blocked-batch` endpoints).

### Architectural principles enforced

- **fail-loud / no-silent-fallback** — adapters RAISE on missing
  data; no stubs.
- **registry-sourced** — read from authoritative GitHub via `gh`;
  scitex-todo doesn't duplicate state.
- **NO hardcoded proper nouns** — watched-repo list is fully
  config-driven; no `["scitex-todo","scitex-dev",...]` literals in
  source.

### Provenance

PR #178 + #179. Lead a2a `74db4f2d` + `10afa799` (refined brief
+ Q&A). Phase-1 subagent execution; T1.1 main-thread.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-06-13 — CLI: bare `board` hard-errors (noun-verb enforcement)

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`scitex-todo board` (no verb) HARD-ERRORS** (PR #176, op TG 13316
  via lead a2a `c36b0d1e`). PR #139 (v0.7.6) had kept it as a
  deprecation-warn-and-forward to `board start`, but that path HID
  the noun-verb violation from audit tools. Bare invocation now exits
  2 + emits a redirect message naming the canonical replacements:

  ```
  ERROR: `scitex-todo board` (no verb) is no longer supported.
  Operator directive TG 13316 — noun-verb CLI convention. Use:
    scitex-todo board start [--port N] [--no-browser]
    scitex-todo board stop
    scitex-todo board restart
    scitex-todo board status
  ```

  In-tree call site migrated: `_jobs_provider.py`'s
  `scitex-todo.dashboard` JobSpec command now reads
  `scitex-todo board start --port 8051`. External call sites (the
  host systemd unit `scitex-todo.dashboard.service` ExecStart + any
  launcher script) need the same migration on the host side. Until
  they do, restarting them will exit 2 + log the redirect — which IS
  the operator's intended forcing function, but coordinate with the
  host-side deploy to avoid disruption.

  14 mock-free CliRunner tests pin the contract (exit code 2,
  redirect message, no forwarding, flags-don't-bypass).

## [0.7.13] - 2026-06-13 — Board UI wave-2: header declutter + Calendar view (4th LAYOUT)

Completes the operator-direct board UI overhaul (lead a2a `d1af161e`
+ `510a58d4`). With the v0.7.12 theme + Table-filter fixes, the
operator's board screenshot complaints (white scrollbar, white
dropdowns, cluttered Table view, cluttered toolbar) are end-to-end
addressed; new Calendar view satisfies op TG 13295.

### Added

- **Toolbar declutter** (PR #173) — the board's overcrowded toolbar
  is reorganized into 3 logical groups + a primary-action zone:
  `view` (LAYOUT toggle / Sort / Group), `search` (Search bar +
  Filters), `status` ("N new" badge / Reload / hide-project), and a
  brand-accent `+Add Task` primary action separated by a divider.
  Responsive wrap at ≤780px. All scitex-ui token-bound (no
  hardcoded colors). Behavior preserved — every original control id
  survives so existing onclick / event handlers / localStorage keys
  keep working. 31 mock-free tests pin the CSS contract + structural
  presence.
- **Calendar view — 4th LAYOUT** (PR #174, op TG 13295) — month grid
  (7×6) with task chips placed by `deadline_next` →
  `deadline` → `last_activity` precedence (pure-function helper
  `taskDateForCalendar` in `calendarDate.ts` for testability). Today
  gets accent ring, past days muted, weekends subtle bg-shift, Today
  pill snaps back to current month, prev/next nav. Chips click-thru
  to the existing NodeDetailPanel drawer. Token-bound; deferrals
  flagged for future PRs (drag-reschedule, week/day view, recurring
  expansion beyond server-provided `deadline_next`, inline edit
  on cell click, full a11y grid contract). 9 mock-free tests pin
  the date-assignment logic + grid generation.

### Provenance

PR #173 + #174 from the operator's design-intent directive +
TG 13295. Subagent-pair execution; both subagents dogfooded
multiplier-#3 (recorded their cards with `--pr-url` post-merge).

## [0.7.12] - 2026-06-13 — Board UI: themed scrollbar+dropdowns + Table-view structural filter

Two operator-direct UI fixes (lead a2a `510a58d4`, op TG screenshot
of the board's white scrollbar + un-themed dropdowns + cluttered
Table view). Header declutter + Calendar view follow in v0.7.13.

### Fixed

- **Themed scrollbar + `<select>`/`<option>` dropdowns** (PR #170) —
  the board's white-in-dark-mode scrollbar and OS-default white
  dropdowns now bind to scitex-ui shell tokens (`var(--col-bg)` /
  `var(--text)` / `var(--border)` / `var(--purple)`). Two layers:
  global `.stx-todo-board, *` fallback in `board.css` + a new
  `board_v3/00-theme-scrollbar-select.css` loaded FIRST in the
  template. 13 CSS-contract tests pin the rule set.

### Added

- **Table view: hide structural cards by default** (PR #171) — the
  `kind=status` quality-axis rows (8 q-*) and `kind=goal` umbrella
  rows (proj-clew / proj-todo / pool-* / ywatanabe-operator-anchor)
  are FILTERED OUT of the Table view by default; a "Show structural
  cards" checkbox in the toolbar flips them back on. Graph + Column
  views are unchanged — they keep showing every card per the
  existing dependency-graph contract. New `tableFilter.ts` helper
  exposes `STRUCTURAL_KINDS` + `isVisibleRow` so the filter is
  pure-function-testable. 5 new TS+Python tests.

### Provenance

PR #170 + #171 from the lead's a2a `d1af161e` (board UI overhaul)
triage. Subagent-pair execution model — one PR each, isolated
worktrees, multiplier-#3 dogfooded (both subagents recorded their
card with `--pr-url` post-merge).

## [0.7.11] - 2026-06-13 — Skill mandate: never hand-edit tasks.yaml

### Added

- **Canonical skill mandate: NEVER hand-edit `tasks.yaml`** (PR #168,
  lead a2a `02c8a4ae`). Folds into the bundled `scitex-todo` skill
  alongside the SSoT MANDATE and the multiplier-#3 PR-merge recording
  mandate. The 2026-06-13 corruption episode traced to a hand-edit
  bypassing the API. Rule: always use the CLI / MCP / Python API; the
  flock + atomic-rename + post-dump-validate path is the only safe
  write. Emergency-repair exception documented (already-broken file
  with backup-first / parse-verify-after / report-to-lead protocol).
  Propagates to every agent's required_skills via `scitex-todo skills
  propagate` (PR #161 mechanism), so every fleet agent reads it on
  boot. 4 mock-free file-content tests pin the load-bearing phrases.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-06-13 — Durable writer safety + CLI: --blocker '' clear

### Fixed

- **Writer: post-dump round-trip validation** (PR #166, lead a2a
  `d5809cd3`) — after the 2026-06-13 corruption episode where
  `~/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml` was found truncated mid-string at line
  ~2784 and recovered by hand. Audit: the existing writer already had
  pre-write `_validate_tasks`, atomic-rename (tmp + fsync +
  `os.replace`), `fcntl.flock`, and tmp-cleanup-on-error. NEW LAYER:
  before `os.replace`, the writer now REPARSES the just-dumped tmp
  file from disk via ruamel and verifies both (a) it parses cleanly
  and (b) the reparsed task count matches the in-memory count. Either
  failure aborts with a `RuntimeError` and the canonical file is left
  untouched — never promote suspect bytes into the SSoT. 7 mock-free
  subprocess-based tests pin the contract (kill-mid-dump leaves
  canonical byte-identical; failed pre-write doesn't create a
  canonical file).
- **CLI: `--blocker ''`/`'none'` clears the field** (PR #165). Dev
  a2a (via lead `f5a54f85`): the strict `_BLOCKER_CHOICE` rejected
  `""` and `"none"` at parse time so there was no CLI form for
  clearing a card's blocker — `campaign-*` cards needing to flip a
  blocker off couldn't be closed from the CLI. New
  `_BlockerOrClearParamType` on the UPDATE verb honours both
  sentinels; ADD verb keeps the strict closed enum (you can't clear
  on insert). 7 mock-free CliRunner tests.

### Provenance

PR #166 + #165. Lead a2a `d5809cd3` + `f5a54f85`. The writer-safety
fix is the structural fix for SSoT-write hazard; the CLI clear-gap
fix closes the dogfooded blocker that surfaced from dev's reconcile.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-06-13 — Fleet-adoption multiplier #3: PR-merge recording mandate

Closes the **board-recording gap** surfaced by the 2026-06-13 reconciliation
pass (199 PRs merged in 24h vs ~5 board completions — structural, not a
hygiene problem). Adds a LOAD-BEARING mandate to the canonical scitex-todo
skill that propagates to every fleet agent via `skills propagate` (#161).

### Added

- **PR-merge recording mandate** (PR #163) — new `## ⚑ MANDATE — record
  evidence at PR-merge / issue-close time` section in `SKILL.md` + a
  sister leaf `60_pr-merge-recording-mandate.md` with the CLI/API/MCP
  verb table, no-PR alternative, bulk catch-up verb (`sync-github
  --since <date> -y`), anti-pattern list, and provenance. Hard rule:
  `scitex-todo done <card-id> --pr-url <merged-PR-URL>` IMMEDIATELY at
  PR-merge time; bare `done` without `--pr-url` is the recording-gap.
  8 mock-free file-content tests pin the load-bearing phrases so they
  can't drift silently. Lead a2a `0cdca03a` approved as fleet-adoption
  multiplier #3, sister to #160 (TaskCreate-redirect hook) and #161
  (skill propagation manifest).

### Provenance

PR #163 (`feat/skill-pr-url-mandate`). Diagnostic source:
`/work/GITIGNORED/RECONCILE_TRACE.json` — the 2026-06-13 reconciliation
pass.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-06-13 — Fleet-adoption multipliers (PreToolUse hook + skill propagation)

Ships the two **fleet-adoption multipliers** so every other agent in the
fleet uses scitex-todo correctly without per-agent buy-in. Lead a2a
`1b5c3b4d` prioritized both over the UX cards because they move the
operator's single-shared-store doctrine forward across the WHOLE fleet
in one bump.

### Added

- **Bundled PreToolUse hook** (PR #160): a bash script in the skill
  bundle (`_skills/scitex-todo/hooks/pre-tool-use/`) that any agent
  drops into `~/.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/` and immediately gets
  the redirect. Intercepts Claude Code's built-in `TaskCreate`,
  `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList` — exits non-zero with a clear stderr
  redirect to the equivalent scitex-todo CLI verb. ENFORCES the
  doctrine, not just warns. Opt-out: `CC_ALLOW_CLAUDE_TASKLIST=1`
  for rare legit uses. 8 mock-free subprocess tests.
- **Canonical skill manifest + `scitex-todo skills propagate`**
  (PR #161): `_skills/manifest.yaml` lists which scitex-todo skill
  IDs every fleet agent should require. `scitex-todo skills
  propagate --agents-dir <DIR>` walks a tree of agent-container
  `spec.yaml` files and idempotently appends those IDs to each
  agent's `required_skills` list (ruamel.yaml round-trip preserves
  comments; SciTeX audit-cli §2 `--dry-run` + `-y`). Supports both
  `metadata.labels.skills` (v3) and `spec.required_skills` (older)
  shapes. 16 mock-free CliRunner tests.
- **Runbook leaf §22 — fleet-wide skill propagation**: documents
  the canonical manifest path + the agent-container integration.

### Provenance

PR #160 + #161 — fleet-adoption multipliers off the lead a2a
`1b5c3b4d` triage. Co-located with the existing P3a chain
(PR #155 / #156 / #158 / #159) so a single PyPI bump unlocks the
WHOLE single-shared-store + agent-redirect story for agent-container.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-06-13 — P3a fleet host-store wire-up + board-reconciliation verbs

Cuts the **P3a throughput unlock** (host scitex-todo store reachable from
every containerized agent, write-safety via flock-scoped RMW) into a
pull-able PyPI release so agent-container can bake the wire into
`to_home/.mcp.json`. agent-container a2a `e330b084` confirmed
`/home/agent/.scitex/todo` bind is fleet-wide; dev a2a
`dd971b57` + `932ea837` independently verified the host's 632-task
corpus is visible from their container. Also rolls up the
board-reconciliation verb sweep landed over 2026-06-13.

### Added

- **`scitex-todo mcp install [--apply] --env-tasks-path <abs/path>`**
  (PR #158) — when set, pins `SCITEX_TODO_TASKS` in the generated
  `.mcp.json` entry's `env` block. Belt-and-suspenders for the
  bind-mount-based host-store resolution; makes the wire-up
  self-documenting in the generated config. Operator P3a, lead a2a
  `a579358e` + `d7789963`. agent-container's one-liner:
  `scitex-todo mcp install --apply --to to_home/.mcp.json --env-tasks-path /home/agent/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml -y`.
- **`scitex-todo mcp install --apply`** (PR #155) — idempotent
  `.mcp.json` merge; the foundation #158 builds on. P3a fleet
  enablement.
- **`scitex-todo stale-list`** (PR #157) — terminal twin of the
  board's `🧹 Stale` panel + `/stale` HTTP endpoint. Lets agents
  reconcile from the CLI without opening the board.
- **`/stale` + `/archive` board endpoints + `🧹 Stale` layout +
  per-row Archive button** (PR #153 backend + #154 frontend) —
  recurring stale-review surface; 128 / ~218 candidate cards
  flagged for operator review at landing.
- **`scitex-todo close <id> --reason ...`** (PR #151) — close-stale-
  with-reason verb (board-reconciliation gap fix); writes
  `status=deferred` + a `[CLOSED]` activity comment.
- **`scitex-todo comment <id> <text>`** (PR #144) — CLI wrapping
  `_store.comment_task` (the PR #64 replacement).
- **Per-row multi-select + bulk status change on the board**
  (PR #150) — PR(h) Stage 1.
- **`kind=status` axis** (PR #146) — non-actionable quality-tracking
  cards; renders distinct from `kind=task` on the board.
- **Activity-bucket badge** (PR #148) — color cards by
  `last_activity` recency (fresh / warm / stale); pairs with PR #122
  backend decay.
- **Directory-card scanner + plan CLI** (PR #142) — PR-D Stage 1,
  operator-direct.

### Docs

- **Runbook §7.5 — fleet MCP enablement via `mcp install --apply`**
  (PR #156) — the P3a chain end-to-end recipe.
- **Board-reconciliation runbook — canonical verbs for fleet sweep**
  (PR #152) — covers the new close / comment / stale-list verbs.
- **Skill refresh — comment verb + kind=status + SSoT write-here**
  (PR #149) — keeps the bundled agent skill in lock-step with the
  current CLI.
- **Container/host tasks.yaml divergence audit** (PR #143) — the
  audit that became the P3a brief.

### Provenance

PR #158 (`feat/mcp-install-apply-env-tasks-path`), lead a2a
`a579358e` + `d7789963` + `f9c78d48` (the write-safety
follow-up — model: single shared file + flock-scoped RMW). Co-tested
with proj-scitex-dev (container end-to-end) and
proj-scitex-agent-container (fleet bind-mount confirmation,
canonical path lock-in).

## [0.7.6] - 2026-06-13 — board lifecycle verbs (start/stop/restart/status + pidfile)

Operator-direct TG12949/12950/12951 (via lead a2a `b5726672`).
`scitex-todo board` was a bare NOUN that directly LAUNCHED — CLI
noun-verb violation, AND no clean way to restart after a card/source
change (`port already in use` was the trap).

### Added

- **`scitex-todo board <verb>` lifecycle CLI** (PR #139):
  - `board start [--port --tasks --no-browser] [--dry-run] [-y]` —
    foreground launch, writes `~/.scitex/todo/board.pid` (env-
    overridable via `SCITEX_TODO_BOARD_PIDFILE`).
  - `board stop [--timeout] [--dry-run] [-y]` — SIGTERM the pidfile
    PID; escalate to SIGKILL on timeout.
  - `board restart [--port --tasks --no-browser] [--dry-run] [-y]` —
    stop + start. THIS is the operator's "reload after a source
    change" shape.
  - `board status [--json]` — one-line / JSON read of the pidfile +
    liveness probe.
- SciTeX audit-cli §2 (mutating-verb `--dry-run` + `--yes/-y`) and §4
  (concrete Example blocks) compliance landed in the same PR.

### Changed

- Bare `scitex-todo board` (no verb) stays back-compat: forwards to
  `board start` with a stderr DEPRECATION line. Operator's muscle
  memory survives; the alias will be removed in a future minor bump.

### Provenance

PR #139 (`feat/board-lifecycle-verbs`), lead a2a `b5726672`,
operator-direct TG12949/12950/12951.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-06-13 — per-project lane UNION + board UX rescue + /graph perf

Three operator-visible improvements landed via the overnight
Stage 0-1 chain:

### Added

- **`services.get_board()` UNIONS the global store + every per-project
  lane** (`~/proj/*/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml`, comma-sep override via
  `SCITEX_TODO_LANE_GLOBS`). Skill 30's two-tier rollup is finally
  delivered; the operator's hand-curated `nv-lessons` + 31 other
  neurovista cards become visible on the board (lead a2a
  `1ceec0ef` / `40c0a42d`). Collision policy: project-lane wins on
  id, logged at WARNING. Malformed lane is SKIPPED + logged — the
  board renders the rest. (PR #137)
- **Empty-state banner on the board** when active filters narrow the
  result set to 0 cards (operator TG12911 — "filtering by nv-lessons
  does NOT work at all"). The banner offers a one-click "Clear all
  filters" so a 0-match state can't read as a broken filter. (PR #135)
- **mtime-keyed in-process cache on `/graph` payload** — skips the
  full `_build_graph` rebuild (mermaid + nodes + edges + fleet +
  groups) on cache hits, ~50-100 ms saved per /graph request on a
  500-task store. Cache invalidates on any source mtime change
  (PR #136, plays naturally with the new lane-union mtime = MAX).

### Internal

- `BoardState.lane_paths` exposes the successfully-consumed per-project
  lanes so the FE / tests / future indexer can see what was unioned.
- Suite-wide test isolation: `tests/scitex_todo/conftest.py` autouse
  fixture pins `SCITEX_TODO_LANE_GLOBS=""` by default so existing
  fixture-pure tests don't pick up the test runner's host lanes.

### Provenance

PRs #135, #136, #137. Lead a2a `aa02fb0e` (Stage 2 design ACK) +
`1ceec0ef` / `40c0a42d` (lane-union ACK). YAML SSoT invariant
preserved throughout: read-side union only, no writes.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-06-12 — `_push.deliver` semantics: 30 s timeout + dispatched-on-read-timeout

Third (and likely last) cron-pilot hotfix. The 0.7.3 fix made the
receiver accept the body, but the client gave up too early: SAC's
`/v1/turn` runs the agent turn synchronously (up to ~120 s), and the
5 s client cap aborted before any turn could land in
`session.jsonl`. Probed `/v1/turn` for a fast-ack flag —
`wait=false`/`dispatch_only=true`/`async=true` all reject — so the
pragmatic stopgap (lead a2a `0b59485f`) is to give the client more
time AND treat the client-side read-timeout as "request was already
fully sent, receiver is mid-turn = dispatched success" so one slow
turn can't fail the nudge batch.

### Fixed

- **`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S` 5.0 → 30.0**, env-overridable via
  `SCITEX_TODO_PUSH_TIMEOUT_S`. Reflects the receiver's actual
  budget so short ack-style turns complete cleanly.
- **Read-timeout treated as `DISPATCHED` success**
  (`ok=True, reason="dispatched"`), not `transport-error`. By the
  time the client read-timeout fires, the request body has long
  since been fully transmitted; treating it as success stops one
  slow turn from failing the whole `*/10` nudge batch. Connection-
  refused / DNS / SSL handshake errors still surface as
  `transport-error`.

### Tests

Real localhost `http.server` round-trips (no mocks, STX-NM / PA-306):

- `test_read_timeout_treated_as_dispatched_ok` — handler accepts the
  request body then sleeps past the client timeout; pre-fix this
  returned `reason=transport-error`, post-fix it returns
  `reason=dispatched`.
- `test_default_timeout_env_override` — `SCITEX_TODO_PUSH_TIMEOUT_S`
  reflected at call-time.
- `test_default_timeout_falls_back_to_constant_when_env_unset` — bare
  case yields `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S`.

### Followup (out of scope)

Long-term: sac-listen should grow a real fast-ack endpoint
(e.g. `POST /v1/turn/dispatch` returning 202 + an async session id).
The pragmatic stopgap here can then be reverted.

### Provenance

PR #123 (`fix/push-timeout-env`), lead a2a `0b59485f` (root-fix
directive: not just a bigger timeout but DISPATCHED-success
semantics), proj-scitex-todo overnight mission.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-12 — `_push.deliver` payload aliases `text` to `body` (SAC /v1/turn unblocked)

Second hotfix found via the P3a(c) cron pilot. The 0.7.2 fix made the
cron survive its tick, but the POST then failed at the *receiver*:
SAC's `/v1/turn` (and `claude-code-telegrammer`'s TURN_URL) require a
`text=<msg>` field, while `_push.deliver` only sent `body=<msg>`. The
receiver returned `HTTP 400 "missing or empty 'text' field"`, so the
whole nudge chain still produced zero delivered turns.

### Fixed

- **`_push.deliver` now sends BOTH `text` and `body`** in the payload.
  `text` satisfies SAC + the telegrammer; `body` stays for back-compat
  with any pre-existing consumer keying off scitex-todo's historical
  name.

### Tests

Real localhost `http.server` round-trips (no mocks, STX-NM / PA-306):

- `test_post_carries_text_field_aliased_to_body` — the payload
  round-trip pins both fields.
- `test_succeeds_against_text_strict_receiver` — end-to-end against a
  stdlib `HTTPServer` that mimics SAC's 400-on-missing-text
  validation; pre-fix this returned `reason=http-error`, post-fix
  it returns `reason=delivered`.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-12 — coerce naive ISO timestamps to UTC-aware (unblocks `--notify` cron)

Hotfix for the 10-min structural-nudge cron shipped in 0.7.1. The
P3a(c) cron pilot caught a `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive
and offset-aware datetimes` raised by `_throughput._hours_since` on
the first `tasks.yaml` row whose `last_activity` was serialized
without a timezone suffix (e.g. `"2026-06-08T00:42:30"` vs.
`"2026-06-08T00:42:30Z"`). The cron then died silently every tick
BEFORE any POST fired, so no agent ever received a structural nudge.

### Fixed

- **`_throughput._parse_iso` always returns UTC-aware.** Naive ISO
  strings are coerced to UTC — the canonical assumption for
  `tasks.yaml` timestamps. One offending row no longer kills the
  entire `--notify` / `--nudge-quiet` sweep.

### Tests

- `TestNotifyBody::test_naive_last_activity_does_not_crash` —
  composes a notify body for a task whose `last_activity` lacks a
  timezone suffix.
- `TestParseIso::test_naive_string_coerces_to_utc_aware` — direct
  unit check on the helper.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-12 — 10-min structural-nudge cron + `--nudge-quiet` flag

Operator standing direction (lead a2a `19d575415a` + revision
`9e710ab074ef4bf3a615be41793e0c51`, 2026-06-12): the structural
feedback loop must push per-agent nudges every 10 minutes, not on
manual lead intervention. The 10-min threshold is the operator's
"silence + in_progress = escalation" rule from TG12600.

### Added

- **New `--nudge-quiet` flag on `scitex-todo print-stats`.** Per-agent
  sweep: if any open `in_progress` task hasn't been touched in
  `SCITEX_TODO_NUDGE_QUIET_MIN` (default 10) minutes, push a
  quiet-nudge body via `_push.deliver(kind="quiet-nudge")` — the
  same self-contained HTTP push wire 0.7.0 introduced. Composes the
  full per-agent open list (RUNNABLE first, BLOCKED after) so the
  recipient sees the full picture, not just the stalled row.
- **`scitex-todo.notify` JobSpec** in `_jobs_provider.provide_jobs`.
  `kind="oneshot"` + `schedule="*:0/10"` → systemd runs it every 10
  minutes via the existing `scitex-dev ecosystem up` federation.
  Command: `scitex-todo print-stats --by agent --notify --nudge-quiet`.
  Pairs with the v0.7.0 UI nudge button: the cron is the STRUCTURAL
  feedback path; the button is the manual override.

### Out of scope

- Stdio MCP channel server + board-event poller (operator TG12618
  long-term plan) — tracked as PR (j) in the queue.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-12 — Self-contained push channel + nudge button + comment relay

Operator standing direction (lead a2a `f16b0d2a` + `9e710ab0` +
`8e51b1e0` + `ffc6629c80e4462a8401fb7e4ebb7240`, 2026-06-12,
operator TG12608 / TG12611 / TG12617): scitex-todo must NOT depend on
the `sac` CLI for outbound notifications. The package owns its own
push delivery, the contract is HTTP (not Python imports), and silent
fallbacks are forbidden — failures must be loud-but-not-fatal so the
operator can fix the config without breaking the running board.

### Added — `src/scitex_todo/_push.py` (self-contained HTTP push wire)

- `deliver(agent, body, *, kind=..., task_id=..., store_path=...)` —
  resolves the agent's turn URL from `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_TURN_URLS`
  (JSON map, canonical) or `SCITEX_TODO_TURN_URL_<AGENT_SLUG>` (per-
  agent fallback, same shape as claude-code-telegrammer's
  `TURN_URL`). POSTs a JSON envelope (`agent` / `kind` / `body` /
  `task_id` / `store_path` / `ts` / `source: scitex-todo`) and
  returns a structured result with `ok`, `wire`, `reason`,
  `status`. No `sac` dependency.
- `SCITEX_TODO_PUSH_DRY_RUN=1` short-circuits to stdout; useful in
  test / dev.
- `announce_missing_at_boot(tasks)` lists distinct agents in the
  store that have no turn URL configured; emits a single WARN log
  at board startup. Operator can iterate the config without a board
  restart per agent.

### Added — `POST /nudge` Django endpoint + UI button (PR g)

- New handler `_django/handlers/nudge.py` registered as the `nudge`
  endpoint. Body `{"agent": "<name>"}`. Composes the same per-agent
  body the `stats --notify` cron uses (`build_notify_body`) + an
  appended ACTION ask ("push or BLOCKED within 15 min"), then
  invokes `_push.deliver(agent, body, kind="nudge")`.
- Per-agent in-process cooldown (`COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 5 * 60`)
  matches the operator's spec; cooldown hit → HTTP 429 with the
  remaining seconds.
- UI: per-column `🔔` button (next to the existing `📌 pin` button).
  Click resolves the column's PRIMARY agent (modal agent among
  the column's tasks) and POSTs `/nudge`. Toast surfaces every
  result branch — success / no-turn-url-configured / http-error /
  cooldown-active / no-agent-attribution.

### Changed — Comment-relay hook on `POST /comment` (PR g)

- When a comment's `author != task.agent`, `handle_comment` invokes
  `_push.deliver(target, body, kind="comment-relay", task_id=...)`
  AFTER the write succeeds. Best-effort; relay failure does NOT fail
  the comment write. Relay outcome surfaces in the response so the
  UI can render a toast ("📨 relayed → <agent>" / failure marker).
- Comment-relay body invites the agent to reply via
  `scitex-todo comment <task-id>` (CLI) or `add_comment` / `comment_task`
  (MCP) — both surfaces are already available in v0.5.x.

### Changed — `print-stats --notify` migrated to `_push.deliver`

- `_cli/_stats.py::_push_notify` now calls `_push.deliver(agent,
  body, kind="notify")` instead of `subprocess.run(["sac",
  "agents", "send", ...])`. Same per-agent body as before; the wire
  swap is transparent to callers.

### Changed — Board boot announce (`board_v3_page`)

- Once per process, the board page logs a WARN listing the agents
  in the store with no turn URL configured. Single-shot via
  `_TURN_URL_ANNOUNCED` module flag.

### Tests

- `tests/scitex_todo/test__push.py` — 12 tests against a localhost
  `http.server` capture (no mocks, STX-NM / PA-306). Covers env
  resolution (JSON map + per-agent fallback + malformed JSON +
  missing), HTTP 200 / 4xx / transport-error, dry-run, and
  `announce_missing_at_boot`.

### Out of scope

- Dedicated stdio MCP channel + board-event poller mirroring
  claude-code-telegrammer's `~/proj/claude-code-telegrammer` shape —
  operator TG12618 long-term plan. Tracked as PR (j) in the queue.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-12 — `stats` CLI + WIP-validation gate + `sync-github` verb + `--notify` push

Operator standing direction via lead a2a `4b23ebc1` + `7489ac31` +
`6f24a752` + `5263c8d9` + `02b71bd0` + `130cc5ac` + `d99b8de6` +
`5acfbb5d` (2026-06-12): the fleet must measure its own creation vs
completion rate, push the per-agent numbers hourly so receivers
self-correct, hard-throttle add-task at 2× the agent's WIP limit, and
absorb GitHub merges back into the canonical board automatically.

### Added — `scitex-todo print-stats`

- New CLI: `scitex-todo stats [--by agent|project|host] [--since
  YYYY-MM-DD] [--format text|json] [--notify]`.
- Per-group rows: `name / open / stale / created / completed / delta
  / ratio / velocity_per_day`. Source = canonical `tasks.yaml`. The
  `created_at` field anchors the window; `last_activity` anchors the
  `done` projection; `in_progress` rows older than
  `SCITEX_TODO_STALE_HOURS` (default 24) count as `stale`.
- `--notify` (agent grouping only): for each agent, push a body via
  `sac agents send <agent> <body>` (stdout fallback when `sac`
  unavailable). Body layout: HEADER (counts + ratio) → RUNNABLE
  tasks first, then BLOCKED (depends_on-gate / blocker-reason),
  capped at 10 + `+ N more`, then a RECENT DONE section. `⚠` marks
  stale in_progress so receivers see neglected work at a glance.

### Added — `scitex-todo sync-github`

- New CLI: `scitex-todo sync-github [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--dry-run]`.
- Permanent version of the lead's 2026-06-12 one-time GitHub→board
  sync. Pulls `ywatanabe1989/*` merged PRs in the window, matches by
  `pr_url` (and creates new `status=done` records for unmatched PRs),
  collapses mechanical CI-speedup PRs (`title contains "ci-speedup"
  | "L1-L5"`) into a single bundle task per day.
- Designed for the scitex-dev cron registry's hourly poll — the lead
  registers the JOB_REGISTRY entry; this PR ships the verb itself.

### Added — WIP-validation gate on the write side

- `_store.add_task` now consults `_throughput.evaluate_wip(tasks,
  agent)` BEFORE the append. The agent's open-task count (`status
  NOT IN {done, goal}`) drives:
  - `>= SCITEX_TODO_WIP_LIMIT` (default 20) → WARN to stderr.
  - `>= 2 × SCITEX_TODO_WIP_LIMIT` → `TaskValidationError` HARD
    REFUSE; the message names the agent + the count + the limit.
- Goal-tier umbrellas (`status == "goal"`) are explicitly excluded
  per lead-confirm `5acfbb5d`.
- The gate is CLI/MCP/Python-path only — direct YAML hand-edits
  bypass it by design (operator wants the normal path made fat so
  hand-edits are unnecessary, not policed).

### Added — `_throughput.py` shared aggregator

- New module `src/scitex_todo/_throughput.py` — the single source of
  truth for "open" / "stale" / "completed" / "RUNNABLE" / "BLOCKED"
  semantics across the three new surfaces (stats CLI, WIP gate,
  notify body). The dependency classifier (`classify()`) is
  operator-confirmed defensive: an `depends_on` reference to a task
  id that doesn't exist returns `BLOCKED(→ unknown:<id>)` rather
  than silently treating it as RUNNABLE (lead-confirmed `130cc5ac`).
- 26 unit tests in `tests/scitex_todo/test__throughput.py` covering
  `aggregate` (groupings, status semantics, stale flag, unassigned
  rendering), `classify` (RUNNABLE / BLOCKED / unknown-dep
  defensive / status-blocked precedence), the WIP thresholds
  (warn / refuse / agent-attribution short-circuit), and the
  `--notify` body (RUNNABLE-first sort, truncation, ⚠ on stale,
  recent-done section).

## [0.5.9] - 2026-06-12 — Filterbar reorganization (3-group layout)

Operator UX feedback (lead a2a `b48f7c2c438b464698183d2e95d3bb04`,
2026-06-12): `current UI/UX is terrible` — the filterbar grew to
~108 px tall because every control sat in a single `display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap` row and the wrap order was chaotic. Reorg into three
explicit groups so the placement is intentional, not flex-wrap-roulette.

### Changed

- **HTML**: wrap filterbar children in `.fb-left` (identity:
  title + version + LIVE chip) / `.fb-center` (search input +
  autocomplete suggest dropdown) / `.fb-right` (Layout segment +
  Sort + Filters popover + Recent count + Group + Add Task +
  blocking-me + project-hide + hidden + Reload).
- **Second row** `.filterbar-chips` — active filter chips
  (`#filt-chips`) + qualifier hint pills (`#filt-qhints`) moved off
  the main row into a slim band shown ONLY when populated (via
  `:has(...:empty)` selector). Default state collapses to a single
  ~48 px row.
- **CSS**: `.filterbar { display: flex; min-height: 48px }` with NO
  top-level wrap. The `.fb-right` group wraps internally on narrow
  viewports so the identity + search row stays intact regardless of
  how many right-side controls are visible.
- **Removed** the `margin-left: auto` hack from `.toggle-block` —
  explicit grouping now controls position; the auto-margin pushed
  this single button to the right edge in the old layout, which was
  the source of the asymmetric wrapping the operator photographed.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-06-12 — Graph view edges fix + fleetstrip removal + search-kbd pill folded into placeholder

Operator-reported regressions on `/`, lead-approved fixes:

### Fixed — Graph layout had no edges

- Lead `c212aa72bb0a4161b4faa8e81d508bc8` / `8af2a4a65fe94c9aa0e5f774598127a0`.
  PR #108's Graph view tried to read `t.depends_on` / `t.blocks` per-node
  and emitted a 400-node, 0-edge layout (41 552 px tall — operator
  element-inspector confirmed). The `/graph` endpoint doesn't expose
  those per-node — it returns them aggregated at top-level
  (`STATE.graph.edges`, 26 entries in the operator's live store).
  Hierarchical `parent` edges (111 of them, per-node) were also
  missing.
- Fix: `_renderGraphView` now consumes `STATE.graph.edges` directly
  for the depends_on / blocks set, and walks `t.parent` for the
  hierarchical edge set. Edges are visually distinguished — solid
  arrows for depends_on / blocks, dashed for parent. Graph is
  filtered to the connected component (nodes touched by ≥1 edge);
  disconnected nodes render in Column / Table layouts only.
- New empty-state: when 0 edges among the visible scope, the canvas
  shows a friendly explanation pointing at the `depends_on` / `blocks`
  / `parent` YAML encoding so the operator can fix the data.

### Removed — empty fleetstrip + standalone kbd-hint pill

- Lead `032e41545fcf4ab4b98d864ec1770249`. The `div#fleetstrip`
  rendered as `Content: none` because the payload never populated
  `STATE.graph.fleet` — operator: "i dont need this". The element +
  the orphan `renderFleetStrip()` helper are removed; fleet-liveness
  lives in the lead's periodic reports.
- The standalone `span.filt-search-kbd` "press / to focus" pill is
  removed. The same hint is now inline in the search input's
  placeholder text — operator: "just write the kbd in the search box".

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-12 — User lane normalization + tighten left space + age pill + finish BLOCKING-YOU removal

Lead-HOLD-approved follow-up to 0.5.6 (PR #107, rebased on top of the
P0 LAYOUT-axis + Recent-sort merge):

### Changed — User lane normalization

- **The 360 px BLOCKING-YOU right-side aside is now FULLY removed.**
  0.5.6's render-refactor removed the JS that populated `#block-rows`
  but left the `<aside id="right-panel">` HTML in the template — the
  operator saw "loading…" forever in the right sidebar. This PR
  finishes the job: the `<aside>` block + the mobile `#by-fab` toggle
  + the `toggleByDrawer` / `updateByFabBadge` helpers are all
  removed. Operator-decision-blocked tasks live in the synthesized
  `user` lane in `_renderColumnView` (a normal column with normal
  width, drag-reorder, pin, column-context-menu).

### Changed — Left space tightened

- Board overrides the scitex-ui standalone shell so the
  `ws-ai-pane` (console / chat), `ws-worktree-pane` (file tree), and
  `ws-viewer-pane` (file viewer) are `display: none`. The kanban
  doesn't need any of those, and the operator reported "left empty
  space" eating the columns area. The `ws-module-pane` (board
  content) now uses the full viewport width.

### Added — Card age pill

- Each card carries a `⏳ Nd` pill in the header next to
  `last <activity>`. Stale color buckets:
  `today` mint-green "new" / `fresh 1–6d` muted / `aging 7–29d`
  amber / `stale 30–89d` orange / `rotten ≥90d` saturated red.
  Source is `created_at` (preferred) with `last_activity` fallback;
  null when neither parses (back-compat: legacy data shows no pill
  instead of `NaN`).
- CSS in `board_v3/02-card.css` (`.age-pill` + 5 modifiers, same
  shape as the existing `.date-pill` family).

## [0.5.6] - 2026-06-12 — Board v0.5.4 P0: empty-pill fix + LAYOUT axis + Recent sort

Lead-prioritized fix after PR #105 verification miss surfaced two
still-broken symptoms on `/` (the operator's primary board page):

### Fixed — cards rendered as empty pills on every lane

- Diagnosed against the live store at `:8051`: `business` lane's 28
  cards rendered with `offsetHeight = 24 px`; `scitex-dev` 68 cards at
  18 px; `paper-scitex-clew` 15 cards at 42 px. Root cause: `.col-body`
  is `display: flex; flex-direction: column` and `.main { height:
  100%; overflow: hidden }` (added in 22b6a6f to keep the BLOCKING-YOU
  aside from stretching). Inside a bounded flex column container,
  child `.card` items defaulted to `flex-shrink: 1` and compressed
  down to the card-status row when content exceeded container height.
- Fix: `.card { flex-shrink: 0 }` in `board_v3/02-card.css`. Cards
  keep their natural content height; the existing `.col-body
  { overflow-y: auto }` lets excess content scroll inside the column.
  Verified live by injecting the rule via Playwright `add_style_tag`:
  every lane's first card grew from 18-42 px back to 111-150 px.

### Added — LAYOUT axis (Graph | Column | Table) + Recent sort

Lead design ruling (TG 12461, operator-confirmed): the board renders
the SAME data along two orthogonal axes — LAYOUT (Graph | Column |
Table) sits in the filterbar; TIME (Recent) is a SORT mode in the
existing Sort dropdown, applies across all layouts.

- **LAYOUT switcher** — three segmented buttons in the filterbar.
  Persisted in `localStorage["scitex-todo:layout"]`.
  - `📋 Column` — the existing kanban (default).
  - `📑 Table` — flat rows view, sortable, click a row to open the
    detail drawer. Status / Title / Project / Blocker / Priority /
    Last activity columns.
  - `📊 Graph` — depends_on / blocks mermaid graph, lazy-loads
    `mermaid@10` from jsdelivr the first time the operator switches
    to it.
- **Recent sort mode** — `Recent (newest first) 🆕` option added to
  the existing `#f-sort` dropdown. Cards sort by `last_activity →
  created_at` desc; cards with activity in the last 24 h get a gold
  `NEW` badge in `.card-top`. The badge renders across every layout
  when sort = recent. Persisted in `localStorage["scitex-todo:sort"]`.
- **🆕 N new in 24 h pill** — always-visible filterbar indicator
  showing how many of the currently-visible cards moved in the last
  day. Click to set Sort = Recent. Hidden when zero.

CSS lives in a new sibling file `board_v3/06-layout-and-recent.css`
(keeps the per-file CSS under the 512-line hook limit). Linked from
`board_v3.html`'s `{% block extra_css %}`.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-12 — Board v0.5.3 display fix (template leak + bundle/template food)

Operator-reported regression after the 0.5.3 release:

- Multi-line `{# … #}` comment block leaked verbatim ("`{# searchQuery.js …
  #}`") into the rendered HTML at the top of every board page.
- Cards in every lane rendered as empty pills (no text) — `board_v3/*.css`
  had been wiped from the static dir.
- View toggle (Graph / Table / Recent) was invisible — the React SPA bundle
  was out of sync with the TypeScript source.

### Fixed

- **Template comment leak** (PR #105). Replaced the two multi-line `{# … #}`
  blocks in `board_v3.html` with `{% comment %} … {% endcomment %}`.
  Django's `{# … #}` is single-line only; multi-line blocks render their
  body as page text. Already pinned by
  `test_standalone_template_does_not_leak_django_comment` in
  `tests/scitex_todo/_django/test_views.py`.
- **Bundle/template food (root cause)** (PR #105). The vite config wrote
  into `../static/scitex_todo` with `emptyOutDir: true`, which wiped the
  SIBLINGS of `assets/` on every rebuild — `favicon.svg`,
  `board_v3/*.css`, and `board_v3/searchQuery.js`/`searchSuggest.js` are
  all tracked-in-git static assets consumed by the live `board_v3.html`
  template. We now scope `outDir` to the `assets/` subdir, so a rebuild
  only ever touches the React SPA bundle and never the board_v3 statics.
- **Bundle rebuild from current TS source** (PR #105). Clean
  `npm install` + `vite build` ran against the post-#104 source so the
  shipped `assets/index.js` / `assets/index.css` matches the TypeScript
  source (the Graph / Table / Recent toggle ships with the bundle).

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-12 — Board UX wave + self-consuming loop + deadline schema

Captures every PR that landed between 0.5.2 and develop tip (operator
TG 12028 / 12038 / 12081 wave).

### Added — Board UX

- **Search-as-launcher** (PR #86). `#f-search` becomes the primary
  filterbar control; press `/` from anywhere to focus, `Esc` to blur.
  Purple-haloed at rest, brighter on focus, kbd-hint chip advertises
  the affordance.
- **Filter UX collapse + active chips + sort-by** (PR #89). Six
  filter dropdowns hide behind a single `🔧 Filters (N active)`
  popover; active filters render as removable chips; new sort-by
  selector (deadline / priority / status / project / last_activity /
  title).
- **Self-named project-umbrella cards hidden** (PR #87). A card
  whose title matches its column name is suppressed inside that
  column.
- **Move-picker lists ALL projects + Create-new** (PR #88 + #94).
  Right-click → Move picker is a Combobox over every project in the
  store with `+ Create '<query>'`.
- **Combobox primitive in scitex-ui** (scitex-ui #36 + #37, consumed
  via PR #94). Fuzzy-typeahead select layered over the six filterbar
  dropdowns + the move-picker; pure-JS bundle for Django-template
  consumers.
- **Project GROUPS** (PR #91). User-defined clusters of projects;
  new top-level `groups:` key in `tasks.yaml`; `spans_all: true`
  banner above the grid; group-header rows between clusters.

### Added — Deadlines + org-mode bridge

- **`deadline` + `scheduled` fields on `Task`** (PR #92). ISO-8601
  strings; validator rejects empty / unparseable / `deadline <
  scheduled`.
- **Org-mode export adapter** (PR #93). `build_org(tasks) → str`
  emits `DEADLINE:` / `SCHEDULED:` + properties drawer. 17 tests.
- **Multi + recurring deadlines** (PR #97). Org-style repeater suffix
  on the single field (`+1w` / `++2m` catch-up); optional `deadlines:
  list[str]` mutually exclusive with the single field; server emits a
  synthetic `deadline_next` for FE consumption.

### Added — Self-consuming board loop (operator TG 12038)

- **`scitex-todo next` CLI verb** (PR #95). Canonical "what to pick
  up next" predicate. `--mine` reads `SCITEX_TODO_AGENT`;
  `--auto-claim` atomic-flips to `in_progress` + stamps a starting
  comment in one write.
- **`scitex-todo watch --push` CLI verb** (PR #95). Polls tasks.yaml,
  diffs, POSTs `/v1/turn` to the owning agent's a2a port on
  new / commented / status-changed tasks. Watcher declared as a
  second `kind=service` JobSpec.
- **Agent self-consumption loop sub-skill (32)** + **MANDATE block in
  `SKILL.md`** (PR #90 + #95).

### Fixed

- **P1 + P7 regressions restored** (PR #96). The P10/P11 squash wave
  silently dropped P1 #86 + P7 #87 from develop; PR #96 restores both
  and pins **24 substring signatures** in
  `tests/scitex_todo/test__board_v3_signatures.py` so future squash
  drops fail CI instead.

### Notes for operators

After upgrading: `systemctl --user restart scitex-todo.dashboard`.
The new `scitex-todo.wake-watcher` unit needs
`systemctl --user reset-failed scitex-todo.wake-watcher` followed by
`systemctl --user enable --now scitex-todo.wake-watcher`.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-08 — Crash-safe store + version label + Uncategorized column

Patch release in response to the 2026-06-08 autoassign-parallel-run
data-loss incident: roughly 130 operator-added tasks lost when two
concurrent autoassign scripts were SIGTERM'd mid-`save_tasks` dump
and the store was left half-written. This release closes the bug at
the store layer + makes the live release visible on the board.

### Fixed (crash-safety, lead a2a `3b0df14a`)
- **Atomic write in `save_tasks`** — dump now goes to a sibling `.tmp`
  file, fsync, then `os.replace(tmp, tasks.yaml)`. POSIX-atomic; a
  SIGTERM/SIGKILL mid-dump can no longer leave the canonical file
  half-written. The pre-existing `fcntl.flock` on the sidecar lockfile
  is unchanged.
- **Git auto-commit on every save** — lazy-initializes a `.git` inside
  the store directory on first save_tasks call, then commits each
  successful write. Operator gets time-travel: `git -C ~/.scitex/todo
  log` + `git show <sha>:tasks.yaml` to restore any prior state.
  Best-effort: a git failure never blocks the actual save.

### Added (board v3)
- **`scitex-todo vX.Y.Z` page title + header** (operator TG 407). The
  live `__version__` is read off the package import and rendered in
  both the `<title>` tag (browser tab) and the in-page H1. No second
  source of truth to drift on release.
- **"Uncategorized" replaces "Ungrouped"** (operator TG 405). The
  no-project column label aligns with the legacy "Uncategorized pool"
  convention from PR #4 and reads as plain English. Internal grouping
  key + filter dropdown both updated.

### Notes for operators
After upgrading: restart your `scitex-todo board` systemd unit.
`~/.scitex/todo` becomes a git repo on the first board write — the
operator can `git -C ~/.scitex/todo log` immediately, no extra setup.
Any future corruption is recoverable via standard git commands.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-08 — Board v3 horizontal layout + column pin + drag-reorder + fleet-liveness

Patch release on top of 0.4.0 to unblock operator UX (TG 370) the
moment they saw 0.4.0 live: project columns stacked vertically with
many projects + no way to reorder / prioritize them.

### Fixed (board v3)
- **Columns now lay out side-by-side with horizontal scroll.** The
  previous CSS grid `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr))` wrapped
  many-column boards into a 40,000px tall stack (operator's element-
  inspector dump confirmed 39929px height). Switched to a single-row
  flex strip with `overflow-x: auto`; each column is a fixed 280px
  wide. Kanban / Trello / Linear convention.

### Added (board v3)
- **Column drag-to-reorder.** Each column section is `draggable`;
  drop on another column inserts BEFORE that target. Order persists
  in `localStorage` under `scitex-todo:col-order` (per-browser
  preference, no backend change).
- **Column pin (📍 / 📌).** Per-column pin button in the header.
  Pinned columns float to the LEFT of the strip regardless of drag
  order. Persists in `localStorage` under `scitex-todo:col-pinned`.
- **Fleet-liveness dot-strip** (PR #75) — one colored dot per agent
  in the filter bar, gold/green/blue/grey by status, click toggles
  the agent filter. Powered by a new `fleet` summary on `/graph`
  (additive — no schema change).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-08 — Board v3 + scitex-ui shell + task-harvest skill

The shared-fleet board matures into a real Django app: the live
**board v3** (kanban + BLOCKING-YOU panel + Resolve → notify wire) is
promoted to the package root and now extends the **scitex-ui shell**
so it picks up the Alt+I element-inspector + shared chrome for free.
The **Task dataclass** becomes the single schema source. The
**task-harvest skill** documents the operator-commissioned backlog
burn-down loop (2-state model, 4-value blocker enum, root-blocker
walk, `scitex-dev cron` registration). Compute-state-deps + decision-
nodes + ports skeleton land for the north-star roadmap.

### Added (board)
- **Board v3** — live Django board (kanban-style columns, status
  filters, BLOCKING-YOU panel, Resolve → a2a notify wire). Promoted to
  root URL (`/`); legacy GraphView demoted to `/legacy/`. (#57, #58.)
- **scitex-ui shell integration** — board v3 extends
  `scitex_ui/standalone_shell.html`, so Alt+I element-inspector +
  shared chrome work the same way on board v3 as on the legacy
  GraphView. Compatibility with scitex-hub register-as-module via
  `scitex_app._django.ScitexAppConfig` preserved. (#69.)
- **CRUD endpoints** on the Django backend (`/create`, `/update`,
  `/delete`, `/comment`, `/edge`, `/restore`, `/priority`, `/resolve`)
  — see `handlers/crud.py`; UI wiring on board v3 ships incrementally.
- **Board v3 Resolve safety** — 2-click confirm + Undo toast + new
  `/reopen` endpoint so an accidental Resolve is recoverable. (#61.)
- **Board v3 comments + priority + hide** — Word-style comment thread
  + per-card priority up/down + hide button. (#62.)
- **ESC closes the detail modal** (operator TG 265). (#59.)
- **Drill-down clarity** — empty-state explainer, Pool label, Back
  button + region labels (Board / Drill / Canvas / Pool) + count
  breakdown (Total·Showing·Nested·Pool). (#50, #51.)
- **Hover affordance** — replace parent-node tilt with a "⊞ Drill in"
  hover-hint pill (operator TG 245). (#53.)

### Added (schema / Task dataclass)
- **Task dataclass = single schema source** (#56). All schema
  validation flows through one dataclass; `_validate_tasks` consumes
  it; the Gitea adapter + the future README-frontmatter SSoT both
  consume the same shape. 9 new operator fields (`task` /
  `last_activity` / `host` / `pr_url` / `issue_url` / `agent` /
  `project` / `goal` / `created_at`) land.
- **D11 stamping** (#67) — `created_at` is auto-stamped on `add_task`;
  `last_activity` is auto-stamped on `update_task`.
- **Field-flag expansion for `add` / `update`** + closed-enum CLI
  validation (#65). Every operator-facing field is now a `--flag` on
  the CLI; closed enums (`status` / `kind` / `blocker`) reject typos
  at write time.
- **Compute-state-deps north-star pillar #1** (#52) — `kind` enum
  (`task` / `compute`) + compute metadata (`job_id` / `host` /
  `command` / `started_at` / `finished_at`) + ⚙ glyph + KV table.
  Compute jobs (Spartan / SIF builds / CI) become first-class graph
  nodes that external watchers can flip done.
- **Decision-nodes + closed BlockerKind enum** (#54) — `kind: decision`
  + ⚖️ glyph + LOUD operator-decision halo + "unblocks N" impact badge
  + 👤 awaiting-you lens. North-star pillar #4.
- **Core / Extension Ports / Fleet Adapters skeleton** (#55) — ADR-0006
  backbone for the open-source / fleet-adapter split.

### Added (skills)
- **`11_adopting-from-a-project`** (#60) — 30-second adoption how-to
  for project agents to write their tasks into the shared board.
- **`40_task-harvest`** (#70, #72) — operator-commissioned backlog
  burn-down protocol: 2-state model (BLOCKED + reason + dependency
  from a 4-value enum vs RUNNABLE), 2-phase sweep cycle (Phase 1
  re-check blockers + walk `task-dependency` chains to their LEAF
  root-blocker; Phase 2 escalate every RUNNABLE task to its owning
  agent via a2a), lead-centric funnel routing, and registration as a
  `scitex-dev cron` JobSpec.

### Fixed
- **`scitex-todo board --tasks PATH`** now actually pins the server's
  store (was previously a no-op for the Django subprocess — only the
  browser URL query was set). (#46.)
- **Audit pipeline unblocked** — TQ002 / TQ007 + PS-202 / PS-204
  violations fixed. (#68.)

### Notes for operators
After upgrading: restart your `scitex-todo board` systemd unit so the
board picks up the scitex-ui-shell extension. Alt+I + element-
inspector work immediately after restart. CRUD UI on board v3 wires
to the existing endpoints incrementally — Resolve + Priority +
Comment + Hide already land in this release; full Create / Update /
Delete UI ships in a follow-up patch.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-04 — Phase 1 MVP: shared-fleet TODO

The universal-task-layer FLOOR for the agent fleet. Every agent can
read/write the same YAML store across hosts, the board at
http://127.0.0.1:8051 aggregates everyone's tasks for the operator,
and the Python API / CLI / MCP surface follows scitex-dev audit
conventions (Convention A: tool_name == python_api_name).

### Added
- **Per-task `scope` / `assignee` fields** (additive-optional, free-form
  strings). Convention is `agent:<name>` / `project:<name>` / `private`
  but the schema doesn't enforce it (Req 8: be generic).
- **`_log_meta` mapping** — opaque event-stamp dict; `complete_task` writes
  `completed_at` (ISO-8601 UTC, `Z`-suffixed, second resolution) +
  `completed_by`. Phase-2 progress-history substrate.
- **Mutation Python API** (`scitex_todo._store`, re-exported from
  `scitex_todo`): `add_task`, `update_task`, `complete_task`, `list_tasks`,
  `summarize_tasks`, `resolve_store`, `TaskNotFoundError`, `ENV_SCOPE`,
  `ENV_AGENT`. The public top-level surface is narrowed to these six
  task-store functions (plus errors / env constants) to satisfy audit §6
  (Convention A: tool_name == python_api_name). The mermaid / render /
  model / paths helpers remain importable from their submodules
  (`scitex_todo._diagram`, `scitex_todo._diagram`, `scitex_todo._model`,
  `scitex_todo._paths`).
- **CLI write / admin verbs**: `add`, `update`, `done`, `summary`, plus
  `list-tasks` (extended with `--scope` / `--assignee` / `--status`
  filters; backward-compatible default output for existing `list-tasks`
  users), `resolve-store`, `init-store [--shared|--project]`,
  `sync-store [--dry-run|--apply]` (Phase-1 stub). Mutating verbs
  (`add`, `update`, `init-store`, `sync-store`, `mcp start`, `mcp install`)
  accept `--dry-run` + `-y`/`--yes` per audit §2. The pre-audit names
  `list` / `where` / `init` / `sync` were renamed per audit §1 (bare
  transitive verbs at the top level need an object noun).
- **MCP server** (`scitex_todo._mcp_server`) behind the new `[mcp]` extra
  (`fastmcp>=2.0`). Eight tools — six task-store tools follow
  Convention A (tool_name == python_api_name, no prefix): `add_task`,
  `update_task`, `complete_task`, `list_tasks`, `summarize_tasks`,
  `resolve_store`; plus `todo_skills_list` / `todo_skills_get` for
  bundled-skill discovery. `import scitex_todo` works fine without the
  extra installed.
- **`mcp` CLI subgroup** — §3 required four (`start`, `doctor`,
  `list-tools`, `install`). Prefers `scitex_dev._mcp_cli` when present;
  hand-rolled fallback otherwise.
- **`fcntl.flock` mutex** on `save_tasks` (and the new mutators in
  `_store`) holding the full read-modify-write cycle. Phase-1 prereq for
  the Phase-2 cross-host sync substrate (Req 2).

### Documented
- `GITIGNORED/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Phase-0 9-requirement → mechanism map.
- `GITIGNORED/QUESTIONS.md` — open defaults for the operator/lead.
- `GITIGNORED/PROPOSAL_scitex-dev-ecosystem-register.md` — paste-apply
  diff for the lead so `scitex_dev.ECOSYSTEM` includes `scitex-todo`
  (Req 6).

### Test surface
- +47 real tests (no mocks). The two-subprocess concurrent-writer test
  proves the lock serializes interleaved inserts (the failure caught
  while writing it was the source of the `_save_tasks_unlocked` split —
  the lock has to wrap the full read-modify-write, not just the write).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Web board (read-only React-Flow dependency graph) served by Django:
  `scitex-todo board` (needs the `[web]` extra). Nodes colored by status,
  `depends_on` arrows, `blocks` inhibition edges, clickable cards, and
  nested-graph drill-down via a new `parent` task field.
- Drag-reorder write path: the board's `POST /priority` handler persists a new
  ordering back to the YAML store (preserving comments via ruamel) — the first
  agent↔user GUI write surface. `save_tasks` is now public.
- §1a CLI introspection: `list-python-apis` (with the additive `-v/-vv/-vvv`
  ladder) and `mcp list-tools`, both with `--json`.
- Shell completion: `install-shell-completion` / `print-shell-completion`
  (bash/zsh/fish) using the static cache-file pattern.
- Agent skills: bundled `_skills/scitex-todo/` (installation, quick-start,
  python-api, cli-reference, env-vars) plus a self-contained
  `skills {list, get, install}` CLI group.
- `python -m scitex_todo` entry point; `.env.example`; `examples/` with a
  matching `tests/examples/` smoke test; cross-package integration gate.

### Changed
- **CLI verbs renamed** to noun-verb compounds (audit §1): `render` →
  `render-graph`, `list` → `list-tasks` (now with `--json`). Added top-level
  `--help-recursive` and `--json`.
- `_cli.py` split into a focused `_cli/` package (`_main`, `_introspect`,
  `_completion`, `_skills`).
- README rebuilt to the canonical SciTeX layout (logo, badges, Problem/Solution,
  Architecture diagram, Interfaces, footer); `docs/roadmap.md` refreshed.
- Added GitHub Actions: `tests`, `import-smoke`, `quality`, tag-driven
  `release` (PyPI via OIDC + GitHub Release), and the CLA gate.
- Test suite reorganized to mirror `src/` and to satisfy the test-quality rules
  (one assertion per test, AAA markers).

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/scitex-todo/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Canonical YAML task store: top-level `tasks:` list with `id` / `title` /
  `status` (required) and optional `repo` / `depends_on` / `blocks` / `note`.
- `load_tasks` — validating loader (`TaskValidationError` on missing id/title,
  duplicate id, or invalid status). Statuses: `goal`, `pending`,
  `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`, `deferred`, `failed`.
- Mermaid adapter: `build_mermaid` renders `flowchart TB` with `depends_on`
  arrows, `blocks` inhibition edges (`-- blocks --x`), and per-status colors
  (goal = gold `#ffe082`).
- Renderer: `render` (mmdc-first with auto-discovered puppeteer/playwright
  chromium and `--no-sandbox`; `kroki.io` fallback).
- Task-store path resolution following the SciTeX local-state convention:
  explicit path -> `$SCITEX_TODO_TASKS` -> project `.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml`
  -> user `~/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml` -> bundled generic example.
- CLI `scitex-todo` (Click, noun-verb): `render`, `list`.
- Bundled generic example task store at `scitex_todo/examples/tasks.yaml`.
