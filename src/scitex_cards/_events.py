"""Canonical card-event model + single emit seam (foundation C1).

This is **C1** of the card-event / notification foundation epic: a
TYPED canonical event plus a single :func:`emit` that wraps the existing
hook bus (:func:`scitex_cards._hooks.dispatch_event`). It is **pure model
+ a thin emit hook** — there is NO delivery / notification logic here
(that arrives in a later card). The point of C1 is to give every future
PRODUCER (push-hook, merge-Action, release pipeline, deploy step, …)
ONE shape to emit, so consumers can discriminate uniformly.

## Why a typed layer on top of the dict bus

:mod:`scitex_cards._hooks` already fans a *dict* event to built-in
handlers + ``scitex_cards.hooks`` entry-point plugins; ``comment_task``
already emits a ``{"kind": "card-message", ...}`` event through it. C1
does NOT replace that — it adds a typed :class:`Event` whose
:meth:`Event.to_dict` produces a *self-describing envelope*:

.. code-block:: python

    {"kind": "card-event", "type": "<EventType>", ...}

The stable ``"kind": "card-event"`` marker lets existing dict-consumers
tell a C1 event apart from the legacy ``push`` / ``done`` /
``card-message`` / ``unblock`` kinds — the back-compat contract is
preserved: this module NEVER mutates or emits those legacy kinds, and
``comment_task``'s current event is untouched.

## Fail-loud construction (SciTeX constitution)

The ``type`` field MUST be one of :data:`EVENT_TYPES`; an unknown value
raises :class:`EventValidationError` echoing the bad value. Construction
fails loud — but :func:`emit` NEVER raises to the caller (it wraps the
bus the same way ``dispatch_event`` swallows plugin errors), so a
producer is never broken by emit.

    the built-in C4 notify consumer + every entry-point plugin.

    NEVER raises to the caller. ``dispatch_event`` already swallows
    plugin errors, but we wrap the whole call defensively (mirroring
    ``comment_task``'s bus-dispatch try/except) so a producer's primary

    ----------
    event : Event
        The typed canonical event to emit.
    store : path-like, optional
        Override the task-store path, forwarded to :func:`dispatch_event`
        (and through it to the C4 consumer + inbox). ``None`` (default)
        resolves via the normal precedence chain. The ``emit-event`` CLI
        verb threads ``--tasks`` here so the bus/inbox target the SAME store
        the producer points at — deterministic, no env-var mutation.
    entry_points : iterable, optional
        Explicit plugin entry points (``.name`` + ``.load()``), forwarded
        to :func:`dispatch_event`. ``None`` reads the real
        ``scitex_cards.hooks`` group. This is the in-process injection seam
        tests use (no monkeypatch of importlib — PA-306-compliant).

    Returns
    -------
    dict | None
        The :func:`dispatch_event` summary dict (carrying ``kind`` /
        ``card_writes`` / ``plugin_count`` / ``plugin_errors`` plus, for a
        card-event that ran the C4 consumer, a ``notify`` sub-summary with
        ``enqueued`` / ``delivered``). ADDITIVE: this used to return
        ``None``; the value lets a producer / the ``emit-event`` CLI verb
        report what the dispatch did. Returns ``None`` only when the
        dispatch itself raised (the fail-soft branch below) — never
