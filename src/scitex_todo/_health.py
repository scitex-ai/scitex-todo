"""Package-level HEALTH check for scitex-todo (the ``health`` doctor).

One PURE function, :func:`health`, aggregates a fixed set of store / identity /
delivery checks and returns a machine-readable report in the cross-package
standard shape shared with sac/cct::

    {
      "package": "scitex-todo",
      "ok": <bool: true iff EVERY check ok>,
      "checks": [ {"name", "ok", "detail", "hint"}, ... ],
      "summary": <str>,
    }

Contract
--------
* Every FAILING check carries an ACTIONABLE ``hint`` (the exact next step). A
  passing check may leave ``hint`` ``None``.
* :func:`health` NEVER raises: a check that errors internally is reported as
  ``ok=false`` with the error captured in its ``hint`` — no silent pass, no
  vague error, no exception out of the function.

Why this exists (0.7.32 incident)
---------------------------------
The unified ``mcp start`` server once starved its own ``initialize`` handshake
when the inbox poll loop ran blocking store IO inline on the event loop — every
fleet agent showed the ``scitex-todo`` server "not connected". The
``channel_drain`` check below (large unseen backlog with ``seen==0``) turns that
class of failure into a one-command diagnosis.

Testability
-----------
:func:`health` accepts explicit ``store`` and ``agent_id`` params so tests are
HERMETIC — a real ``tmp_path`` YAML store and a literal agent id, no dependence
on the process environment. The thin MCP / CLI wrappers pass ``None`` (resolve
from env).
