"""Single-instance ``flock`` guard for side-effecting one-shot CLI runs.

A small, reusable mirror of the wake-watcher's process-level lock
(:func:`scitex_cards._wake_watcher.acquire_single_instance_lock`, PR #344).
The wake-watcher guards a long-lived polling LOOP; this guards a one-shot
CLI invocation that is re-launched on a schedule.

Motivation (incident-todo-wake-watcher-interval2-spiral-20260708, third
store-size daemon):

  The managed notify cron runs ``scitex-cards print-stats --by agent
  --notify --nudge-quiet`` every 10 minutes. ``print-stats --by agent``
  re-derives per-agent rollups from all ~930 cards in the ~9 MB
  ``tasks.yaml``. When a single run exceeds the 10-min period it OVERLAPS
  the next cron tick, so runs STACK (observed: 2 concurrent at ~63% CPU
  each) — the cron/one-shot analogue of the wake-watcher death-spiral (#344)
  and the MCP inbox-drain spin (#345). Same store-size root; the durable
  fix is archival, but overlapping runs need a stacking guard NOW.

Contract (identical flock idiom to #344):

  * NON-BLOCKING ``flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`` — a run that finds the lock
    already held (a prior run still going) does NOT wait; the caller skips
    the tick cleanly. A skipped nudge tick is fine; the next tick runs.
  * Released on context exit AND automatically on process death, so a
    crashed run never wedges the lock.
  * Guards ONLY the side-effecting path. A plain, read-only ``print-stats``
    (no ``--notify``) never takes or is blocked by the lock.
