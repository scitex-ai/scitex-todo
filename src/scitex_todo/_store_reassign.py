"""Bulk reassignment — move every card owned by one agent to another.

Split out of ``_store_lifecycle`` when adding :func:`reassign_all` pushed that
module past its line budget. ``_store`` re-exports the name below so
``from ._store import reassign_all`` keeps working. The single-card
:func:`reassign_task` stays in ``_store_lifecycle``; this module is the BULK
verb ``sac agents rename`` needs (card ``todo-reassign-all-bulk-primitive``).

The shared helpers (``_read_write_doc`` / ``_utc_now_iso`` / ``_default_agent``)
stay in ``_store`` and are imported inside the function body — a deferred
import, because ``_store`` imports this module at module level to re-export the
verb and a top-level import back would cycle. Same pattern the sibling modules
use for ``from . import _model``.

    """Bulk owner change — move EVERY card owned by ``old_owner`` to
    ``new_owner`` in ONE atomic locked write, then emit ONE batch event.

    The primitive ``sac agents rename`` needs (``todo-reassign-all-bulk-
    primitive``). Mirrors :func:`reassign_task`'s per-card semantics
    EXACTLY — for every matched card it sets ``agent = assignee =
    new_owner``, ``scope = "agent:<new_owner>"``, appends the identical
    audit comment ``"reassigned <old> -> <new> by <actor>"``, and stamps
    ``last_activity`` — but does it for the whole cohort under a SINGLE
    ``_store_lock`` + ``_read_write_doc`` + ``_save_doc_unlocked``.

    Design (why writes and event are decoupled)
    --------------------------------------------
    The WRITES are ATOMIC: one locked read-modify-write moves every card or
    none. The EVENT is emitted AFTER the lock is released, FAIL-SOFT,
    because the emit path enqueues into the recipient inbox and CANNOT run
    under the store lock (it re-loads / re-locks the store and would
    deadlock). Do NOT try to emit inside the lock.

    Recoverability of a lost event does NOT depend on the bus: the durable
    per-card audit comment is written IN the atomic section, so a sweep can
    always find cards now owned by ``new_owner`` whose batch notification
    was never delivered and re-drive it. The event is an accelerator, the
    comments are the record.

    ONE ``reassigned_batch`` event models the ACT (``{from_owner, to_owner,
    count, card_ids}``), NOT the rows — emitting one ``reassigned`` per card
    would be a 158-notification flood, which is the whole reason this verb
    exists.

    Idempotent: a card already owned by ``new_owner`` does not match
    ``old_owner`` and is skipped. Zero matches => ``count == 0``,
    ``changed == False``, NO write, NO event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    old_owner, new_owner : str
        Both required, non-empty. ``old_owner == new_owner`` raises
        ``ValueError`` — a self-rename is meaningless for a bulk verb.
    by : str, optional
        The actor; resolved via ``$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID`` -> ``$USER`` ->
        ``"unknown"``.
    entry_points : iterable, optional
        In-process injection seam forwarded to the event emit (real fake
        handler in tests); ``None`` uses real plugin discovery.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        ``{"from_owner", "to_owner", "count", "card_ids", "actor",
        "changed"}`` where ``changed = (count > 0)``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``old_owner`` / ``new_owner`` is missing/empty, or equal.
