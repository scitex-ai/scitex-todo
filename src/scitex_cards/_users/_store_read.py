any store write rolls the mtime forward, so no reader is served stale rows
across a write. The registry is tiny (a handful of rows) but lives inside the
multi-MB shared store file — the cache skips the FULL-STORE parse (measured
2.7–4.0 s per call on the 8.8 MB live store; the GUI ``/dm/threads`` paid it
on every request), not the row validation, which runs once per cache fill.
READ-ONLY: :func:`load_users` deep-copies rows on the way out because
``User.from_dict`` aliases nested lists — handing out cached rows directly
would let a caller mutate the cache. Write paths use the uncached
:func:`_load_users_section` under the store lock and never read from here.
