"""The delivery ledger — a KEYED DEDUP MAP, the sole source of delivery truth.

This is NOT an append-log. It is a map keyed by ``(recipient,
notification_id, channel)`` whose value records the latest delivery state
for that exact tuple::

    {recipient}\\x1f{notification_id}\\x1f{channel}:
      status: sent | failed
      attempts: 3
      last_ts: 2026-06-27T10:00:00Z
      next_eligible_ts: 2026-06-27T10:00:30Z   # failures only

Persisted as YAML at ``<store_dir>/delivery_ledger.yaml`` where
``<store_dir>`` is the parent directory of the resolved task store
(:func:`scitex_todo._inbox._resolved_store`). Reads go through the fast safe
loader (:func:`scitex_todo._yaml.safe_load`); writes are ATOMIC (temp file +
``os.replace``) and serialised behind the same advisory ``flock`` the task
store uses (:func:`scitex_todo._model._store_lock`), keyed on the LEDGER
path — single-writer per ledger file.

The ledger is what makes delivery idempotent: it answers "have we already
sent this?" (:meth:`Ledger.already_done`) and "is this failed item due for
another try?" (:meth:`Ledger.retry_eligible`) WITHOUT ever touching the
user's inbox ``seen`` cursor (that is the user's read state, separate).
