"""Stale-active + pending-backlog nudge delivery — the enqueue side.

Pairs with the pure detectors in :mod:`scitex_todo._stale_active`:
that module decides WHICH cards are stale-active / pending-backlog and
groups them by owner; THIS module delivers a concise per-owner nudge
over the SAME rail the owner DIGEST uses — the standalone per-recipient
PULL-INBOX (:func:`scitex_todo._inbox.enqueue`, wrapped by
:func:`scitex_todo._reminder_enqueue._safe_enqueue`). One sweep emits up to
two distinct per-owner lines:

* ``stale-active`` (kind="stale-active"): "close/update the in_progress
  / blocked work you said you were doing".
* ``pending-backlog`` (kind="pending-backlog"): "start or triage the
  pending cards you accepted but never began".

Both ride the SAME ``*/10`` ``--nudge-quiet`` cron — no new cron is
added — and both are fail-soft per owner.

WHY THE INBOX RAIL (the 2026-07-12 fix)
---------------------------------------
The nudge originally pushed on the turn-url wire
(:func:`scitex_todo._push.deliver`). That wire is NOT provisioned for
almost any agent, and a containerized agent cannot be POSTed to at all —
so once the sweep was actually scheduled inside notifyd (v0.8.2) it
delivered to NOBODY::

    notifyd liveness sweep: ERR  scitex-todo    32 pending  wire=http  reason=transport-error
    notifyd liveness sweep: ERR  scitex-types    2 pending  wire=http  reason=no-turn-url-configured
    notifyd liveness sweep: # 0 pending-backlog push(es) sent

The DIGEST (:mod:`scitex_todo._reminders`) has always used the rail that
works: it ENQUEUES into the recipient's per-agent pull-inbox, which every
agent already drains. The nudge now uses the SAME path, the SAME helpers
(:func:`~scitex_todo._reminder_enqueue._safe_resolve` /
:func:`~scitex_todo._reminder_enqueue._safe_enqueue`) and the SAME record
shape, so an agent's existing drain picks nudges up with no change on its
side. The turn-url push survives ONLY as an explicitly OPT-IN, strictly
SECONDARY echo (:data:`ENV_NUDGE_PUSH`) for a host-reachable receiver; it
is never a fallback and never decides whether a nudge counted as delivered.

Why a separate module (not inline in ``_cli/_stats.py``): ``_stats.py``
is at the line cap. Keeping the delivery loop here also keeps the pure
detector free of any delivery import so it stays unit-testable with plain
list-of-dicts inputs.

Behaviour (rides the existing ``*/10`` ``--nudge-quiet`` cron):

* NOT liveness-gated. We nudge the owner regardless of whether the agent
  is currently online. An idle / offline owner is exactly the case where
  a stale active card is most likely forgotten; gating on liveness would
  suppress the most important nudges. Detection is purely time-based
  (``last_activity`` recency) — liveness is a separate concern owned by
  the wake-watcher / mesh.
* Fail-soft per owner. A delivery failure (a bad recipient, an unwritable
  store, even an unexpected raise) for one owner is LOGGED as an error and
  the sweep continues — one bad owner never breaks the batch.
* FAIL LOUD. A failed owner is an ``ERR`` line AND a ``logger.error``; a
  sweep where every ATTEMPTED owner failed emits an unmissable ``!! ALERT``
  line (``reached NOBODY``). A quiet "0 sent" is exactly what let the
  turn-url rail ship broken.
* DELIVER ON CHANGE. The sweep is scheduled (the notifyd low-cadence tick
  as well as the ``*/10`` cron), and re-pushing an IDENTICAL nudge on every
  tick is how a signal becomes noise — the same pathology the digest path
  hit on 2026-07-11 (26 identical digests in ~2 h). So a per-(owner, kind)
  fingerprint of the STALE CARD SET is persisted in a sidecar
  (:data:`NUDGE_SIDECAR_NAME`) and the push is skipped while that set is
  unchanged, UNTIL :data:`ENV_NUDGE_FLOOR_HOURS` elapses (a genuinely stuck
  owner is still nudged daily). Suppressed owners are still LOGGED — a
  silent sweep is one nobody trusts.

Optional hook event: when ``SCITEX_TODO_STALE_ACTIVE_EMIT_HOOK=1`` and
the package's hook dispatcher is importable, the sweep also emits a
``stale-active`` finding so scitex-dev's ecosystem reconcile can consume
it. The primary deliverable is the per-owner nudge; the hook emission is
best-effort and never affects the nudge result.
