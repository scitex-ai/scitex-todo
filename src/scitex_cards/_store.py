"""Mutation-side Python API for the scitex-todo task store.

THIN ORCHESTRATOR. The verbs themselves now live in focused siblings; this
module owns the SHARED helpers they all pull on (identity resolution, the
timestamp, the locked read-modify-write loader) and RE-EXPORTS the whole
public surface, so every historical import keeps working untouched —
``from ._store import add_task``, ``_store.complete_task(...)``,
``from ._store import _resolved_store`` / ``load_tasks``, the MCP tool table,
the CLI, the tests.

    _store_mutate      add_task / update_task (+ `_stamp_deferred_at`)
    _store_lifecycle   complete / resolve / reopen / reassign / delete / restore
    _store_comment     comment_task (the card's Issue-activity log)
    _store_relations   set_edge / set_collaborator / set_subscriber
    _store_events      the fail-soft card-event + unblock emit seams
    _store_list        the READ half: list_tasks / summarize_tasks / _match
    _store_write       the LOW-LEVEL persistence layer (lock / save)

Every mutation runs through :func:`_model.save_tasks`, which holds an
``fcntl.flock``-based mutex on a sibling lock file so two concurrent writers
cannot interleave (PHASE 1 prereq for the cross-host sync substrate — see
``GITIGNORED/ARCHITECTURE.md`` Req 2).

The filter functions are read-only and do NOT lock — they snapshot the
store via :func:`_model.load_tasks` and apply the filter in memory.

Design constraints
------------------
- **Generic** (Req 8): scope/assignee/status are free-form strings. The
  helpers don't know what an "agent" is.
- **Centralized** (Req 3): the default store is whatever
  :func:`_paths.resolve_tasks_path` returns; callers can override with an
  explicit ``store=`` path. The user-scope default
  (``~/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml``) covers Req 7.
- **Shared with scopes** (Req 1): ``$SCITEX_TODO_SCOPE`` provides the
  default value for ``list_tasks(scope=...)`` when the caller doesn't pass
  one explicitly. Pass ``scope=""`` (empty string) to ignore the env
  default and see everything.

C5 (card-event producers) wires the mutating verbs to ALSO emit a
canonical :class:`scitex_cards._events.Event` onto the hook bus, plus a
new atomic :func:`reassign_task` owner-change primitive. The mutation→
event mapping (each emit is ADDITIVE + FAIL-SOFT — the mutation persists
first, THEN we emit, and a raising/slow emit can never break or roll back
the write):

    add_task        → ``created``        {card_id, actor, ts}
    comment_task    → ``commented``      (IN ADDITION to the existing
                                          ``card-message`` dispatch)
    update_task     → ``status_changed`` ONLY when ``status`` actually
                      changes {extra:{from,to}} — a completion via
                      update_task(status="done") emits ``completed``
                      (see the completed-vs-status_changed rule below).
    complete_task   → ``completed``      {card_id, actor, ts}
    resolve_task    → ``status_changed`` {extra:{from,to:done}}
    reassign_task   → ``reassigned``     {extra:{from_owner,to_owner}}

Completed-vs-status_changed rule: a flip to ``done`` is modelled as a
single ``completed`` event (NOT also a ``status_changed``) to avoid
double-firing; every OTHER status flip is a ``status_changed``.

There is intentionally NO consumer wired here — delivery / notify is C4
(a separate card). ``reassign_task`` EMITS the ``reassigned`` event; it
does NOT deliver. NO ``sac`` import: this stays a pure producer that
reuses :func:`scitex_cards._events.emit` + the store's own lock/save
helpers.

    file that a fresh install legitimately lacked. Against a database it is a
    loaded gun: an empty doc flows into a read-modify-write, the caller appends
    its one new card, and ``mirror_doc_incremental`` diffs that one-card
    document against the DB and DELETES every card missing from it.

    Measured on a scratch store during this cutover: five sequential writes
    left exactly ONE row each time. On the live board that is 2065 cards down
