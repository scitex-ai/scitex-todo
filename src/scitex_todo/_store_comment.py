"""``comment_task`` — the card's Issue-activity log (append-only).

Split out of ``_store`` (PURE MOVE — no behaviour change), which re-exports
``comment_task`` so ``from ._store import comment_task`` keeps working. It sits
in its OWN module rather than with the lifecycle verbs because the two together
exceed the 512-line cap: a comment is not a state transition — it is the card's
conversation, and it carries its own fan-out (the ``card-message`` bus dispatch
with the owner / collaborators / subscribers snapshot, PLUS the canonical
``commented`` card-event).

The shared helpers (``_read_write_doc`` / ``_utc_now_iso`` / ``_default_agent``
/ ``TaskNotFoundError``) stay in ``_store`` and are imported inside the function
body — deferred, because ``_store`` imports this module at module level to
re-export the verb and a top-level import back would cycle.

    activity-log shape from skill 30, Gitea-compatible field).

    `by` overrides the $SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID → $USER precedence used by
    add_task / complete_task.

    `kind` is an optional feedback-ring / event tag (e.g. ``push`` /
    ``done`` / ``card-message``) stamped onto the entry so the board can
    render "how the card was routed" (operator 2026-06-17). Lenient: the
    model only requires ``text``, so the extra key round-trips cleanly.

    `entry_points` is forwarded to :func:`scitex_todo._hooks.dispatch_event`
    for the ``card-message`` bus emit below: an explicit iterable of
    entry-point-shaped objects to receive the event instead of the ones
    discovered from packaging metadata. ``None`` (the default) uses the
    real installed plugins. This is the in-process injection seam used by
    in-process consumers and by no-mock tests (PA-306-compliant) that
    observe the emitted event via a real fake handler.
