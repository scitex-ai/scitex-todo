"""Tests for the new ``scitex-todo board <verb>`` lifecycle CLI
(operator TG12949/12950/12951 via lead a2a `b5726672`).

The tests cover:

  - the noun-verb group's subcommands are registered
  - `board status` reports "NOT running" when the pidfile is absent
  - `board status` reports "running" + the pid when the pidfile points
    at a live process
  - `board stop` is a no-op on a missing pidfile (clear message, no
    exception)
  - `board stop` SIGTERMs the pid recorded in the pidfile (sub-process)
  - `board start` refuses to start when a live pidfile already exists
  - bare ``board`` HARD-ERRORS with exit 2 + redirect message (operator
    directive TG 13316, lead a2a ``c36b0d1e``)
  - stale pidfile (PID dead) is cleaned up + treated as "not running"

No mocks (STX-NM / PA-306): real subprocesses (Python `time.sleep` loop)
and a tmp pidfile via the ``SCITEX_TODO_BOARD_PIDFILE`` env override.

The actual Django/runserver path is NOT exercised here — `start` from
the lifecycle perspective is the pidfile + dispatch contract; the
runserver itself is covered by the existing Django-management
command's test suite.
