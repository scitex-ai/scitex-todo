"""T1.2 — `runnable()` Python API (the parallelism-engine dispatcher).

Sister to :func:`_next.next_task`, but BATCH (returns the FULL runnable
set, not just the top pick) AND respects `depends_on` (transitive
upstream closure). Lead a2a `74db4f2d`, 2026-06-14 — TRACK 1
(dependency-aware tickets) dispatch backbone.

Filter (RUNNABLE-NOW):
  * ``status`` ∈ {``pending``, ``in_progress``}
  * ``blocker`` is None (an explicitly-blocked row is not runnable)
  * EVERY id in ``depends_on`` references a task whose ``status`` ∈
    {``done``, ``goal``}. A dep on a not-yet-finished task means
    NOT-RUNNABLE-YET. Unknown ids (no matching task in the store) are
    permissive — they fall outside the runnable engine's scope and
    leave the row runnable (matches the same lenient stance the
    graph builder takes on unknown-id edges).
  * For each task Z whose ``blocks: [...]`` list contains this task's
    id: Z must also be in {``done``, ``goal``}. Mirrors `depends_on`
    semantically — explicit "Z blocks this" is the same as "this
    depends_on Z."
  * Optional ``agent`` filter (matches ``agent`` OR legacy
    ``assignee``).
  * Optional ``group`` filter (matches the T1.1 `group` field).

Sort key (lowest = first to dispatch):
  1. ``priority`` ASC, ``None`` ranks LAST.
  2. ``last_activity`` DESC.
  3. ``created_at`` DESC.
  4. ``id`` ASC (deterministic tiebreak).

Distinct from :func:`_next.next_task`:
  - `next_task` returns a SINGLE pick (the agent's "one thing to work
    on now"). It DOES NOT inspect `depends_on` today — assumes the
    operator/lead curates the queue. Kept for back-compat with the
    self-consumption loop.
  - `runnable_tasks` returns the FULL list, respects `depends_on`,
    is what the parallelism dispatcher (lead-side) consumes via the
    `scitex-todo runnable` CLI / `/runnable` endpoint.
