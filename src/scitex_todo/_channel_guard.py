"""Size guards for the scitex-todo channel push path.

The Claude Agent SDK reads server-initiated ``notifications/claude/channel``
messages through a **stdio** JSON reader with a hard 1 MB per-message buffer
(``JSON message exceeded maximum buffer size of 1048576 bytes``). On
2026-07-02 a batch of 180 solver apptainer containers died on boot because an
oversized pushed channel message overflowed that reader. These pure helpers
harden OUR side so a pushed message can never overflow the SDK reader and so a
huge unseen backlog cannot burst all at once on first connect.

Everything here is pure + unit-testable (no live MCP session, no store IO).

#: Hard cap on the UTF-8 byte length of a pushed ``content`` body. Chosen at
#: 256 KiB — a quarter of the SDK's 1 MB (1048576-byte) stdio reader buffer, so
#: even with the ``meta`` block, JSON framing/escaping (which can inflate bytes
#: ~2x for non-ASCII), and base-line RPC envelope, a single push stays far
#: under the limit with generous headroom. Bodies are truncated to this cap.
MAX_CONTENT_BYTES = 256 * 1024  # 262144

#: Per-``meta``-value UTF-8 byte cap. ``meta`` values are small and known
#: (ids, timestamps, event types), so this is belt-and-suspenders only — a
#: pathological value can never contribute meaningfully to the frame size.
MAX_META_VALUE_BYTES = 4 * 1024  # 4096

#: Max records pushed in a SINGLE ``drain_once`` call, across all recipient
#: keys combined. Prevents a first-connect burst (e.g. a 600-message backlog
#: flooding the session in one tick). The remaining unseen records stay unseen
#: and drain on the next poll tick (~5 s later), a few dozen at a time.
