    """Validate a task list in place, raising on the first structural fault.

    The single gate shared by :func:`load_tasks` (read side) and
    :func:`save_tasks` (write side) so a bad mutation can never round-trip
    through the writer.

    The split between STRUCTURE and VALUES is the fix for a fleet-wide outage
    on 2026-07-10.

    The store is SHARED and read by agents running DIFFERENT installed
    versions. When a newer writer stored ``status: cancelled`` (a value its
    own enum knew), every agent on an older build raised here and
    ``load_tasks`` aborted — so ONE unknown value in ONE row took the whole
    fleet's board down. A shared, multi-version store can never grow an enum
    value under that design.

    So, on BOTH sides:
      * STRUCTURAL corruption raises — not a list, missing id/title, duplicate
        id, non-integer priority. That is a broken store, not a newer one, and
        no amount of tolerance makes it readable.
      * A bad VALUE warns, loudly, naming the card and the likely cause. An
        unknown status, a blocked card with no blocker: shouted about, never
        fatal.

    The write side warns rather than raises by operator ruling (2026-07-10:
    "カードが書けないということはなしで大丈夫です、warning で十分です"). Raising
    there was the writer-side twin of the same outage: ``save_tasks``
    validates the WHOLE task list, so a single legacy row written by an older
    agent made every *other* agent's write fail — and the live store grew two
    such rows within hours of the sweep that removed them. The enum is kept
    honest at the SOURCES instead (the CLI's ``--status`` Choice, the MCP and
    board defaults), which reject a bad value before it is ever a card.

    This is not a silent fallback: both sides shout. They simply refuse to
    take the fleet offline, or to cost someone their card, because one row
    came from the future.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tasks : object
        The candidate ``tasks`` value (must be a list of mappings).
    source : str
        A label for error messages (the store path or ``"<save_tasks>"``).
    strict : bool
        Accepted for backwards compatibility; no longer changes behaviour.
        Value faults warn on both paths, structural faults raise on both.

    Raises
    ------
    TaskValidationError
        On any structural fault — see :func:`load_tasks`.

# THE WRITE PATH lives in ``_store_write`` (split out 2026-07-12, when this file
# had reached 1,566 lines by tangling two unrelated jobs: what a task IS, and how
# a task gets to DISK).
#
# Re-exported here because 43 test files and every caller in the package import
# these from ``_model``. The split is an INTERNAL reorganisation and must be
# invisible to them — not an API break.
#
# Imported at the BOTTOM, after everything ``_store_write`` needs from this module
# (StaleStoreError, _validate_tasks, load_doc) is defined. A top-of-file import
# would be circular.
