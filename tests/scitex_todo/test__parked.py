"""`parked`: a deliberately-standing card is not an abandoned one.

The backlog sweep fires on ``deferred`` + untouched. That predicate cannot tell
a card nobody got to (what the sweep is FOR) from a north-star umbrella whose
real work lives in its children. For the umbrella the nudge is unanswerable by
construction, so it fires forever and teaches its reader to ignore the channel —
taking the genuinely abandoned cards down with it.

`parked` is the exemption, and it is a REASON rather than a boolean on purpose.
These tests pin the three properties that make it not-a-mute-button:

1. a park with a stated reason is skipped by the nudge AND by auto-expiry;
2. a park with NO reason (empty / whitespace / non-string) is NOT a park;
3. parking does NOT silence the stale-active guard over `in_progress` — you may
   park work you are not doing, never work you claim to BE doing.
