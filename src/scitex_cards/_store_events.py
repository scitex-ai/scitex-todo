"""Event-emission seams for the store's mutating verbs.

Split out of ``_store`` (pure move, no behaviour change) so the write /
lifecycle / relations modules can share ONE producer seam:

    _emit_card_event              fail-soft emit of a canonical C1 card-event
    _emit_unblock_for_dependents  the ADR-0009 active-unblock DRIVE

Both are called AFTER the mutation is durably persisted and OUTSIDE the store
file lock, and both are FAIL-SOFT: a raising or slow emit can never break or
roll back the write it reports on.

This module is deliberately a LEAF — it imports ``_events`` / ``_hooks`` /
``_model`` / ``_runnable`` / ``_store`` lazily inside the function bodies. That
is not stylistic: ``_events`` imports ``_utc_now_iso`` from ``_store``, and
``_store`` imports THIS module at module level to re-export these names, so a
top-level import either way would cycle.

    A card just flipped to ``done``. Find its DIRECT dependents whose
    last blocking dependency this completion just cleared — i.e. the
    dependents that are NOW runnable — and emit ONE ``unblock`` event
    naming them. A consumer (SAC) notifies each unblocked card's
    assignee + subscribers (*"your task is now unblocked"*).

    "Direct dependent" = a card D with ``completed_id`` in its
    ``depends_on``, OR a card D that ``completed_id`` lists in its
    ``blocks``. "Now runnable" reuses :func:`_runnable.runnable_tasks`
    verbatim (DRY — same dep-satisfied predicate the dispatcher uses):
    a direct dependent that is runnable now could not have been runnable
    before (``completed_id`` was an unresolved upstream), so its presence
    in the runnable set means *this* completion unblocked it.

    Returns the unblocked card ids (possibly empty). Best-effort: this is
    called AFTER the completion is durably saved, so any compute/bus
    error is caught + logged, never raised — feedback must not break the
    done transition it reports on.

    ``entry_points`` is the in-process injection seam (forwarded to
