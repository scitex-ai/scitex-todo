"""Nag-until-closed reminder engine — per-owner digest + operator escalation.

The board is the fleet's direction system, so a requested-and-carded task
that silently stops progressing is a real incident (operator, 2026-06-30).
This engine forces the board to keep surfacing such cards until they are
closed — and to ESCALATE the worst ones to the operator (or, when the
assignee is dead, to the card's creator).

Why a DIGEST, not per-card reminders
------------------------------------
Nagging once PER stale card produced a wall of near-identical lines that
trains the owner to ignore the whole stream (operator, 2026-06-30). Instead:
(a) detect an owner has open assigned cards, (b) periodically surface that
scoped list as ONE digest; the SELECTION of which to advance stays agentic.

What it does each sweep
-----------------------
1. Detect the cards that need nagging — the SAME pure detectors the stats
   cron uses (:func:`scitex_todo._stale_active.detect_stale_active` +
   :func:`~scitex_todo._stale_active.detect_pending_backlog`), by owner.
2. Decide, PER OWNER, whether a digest is *due* now (flat cadence tracked in
   a sidecar so we do not re-nag every tick). Closing/touching cards drops
   them from the stale set and the digest stops — the "until closed" guarantee.
3. Enqueue ONE digest per due owner via the standalone delivery rail
   (:func:`scitex_todo._inbox.enqueue`), listing their open stale cards
   (capped) so the agent picks which to advance.
4. ESCALATE: a HIGH-PRIORITY card still stale after
   :data:`DEFAULT_ESCALATE_AFTER` digests to its owner also enqueues a
   rising-urgency notice to the OPERATOR, once per card, until the card
   leaves the stale set. Escalation stays PER CARD (the operator needs the
   specific stuck card, not a digest).
5. LIVENESS ESCALATE (to the CREATOR): when a stale card's owner is NOT
   ALIVE (:func:`scitex_todo._users.is_alive` off the registry ``last_seen``)
   the assignee will never act, so the card escalates to its ``created_by``.
   Distinct from (4): NOT gated on the digest count or priority (a dead owner
   won't recover by waiting), latched once per streak under
   ``creator_escalated``, falling back to the operator when the creator is
   absent or IS the dead owner itself.

Design
------
* The reminder STATE lives in a sidecar ``reminders.yaml`` next to
  ``tasks.yaml`` — card payloads are never mutated (detectors stay pure).
  Two sections: ``owners: {owner_name: {count, last_at}}`` (the per-owner
  digest cadence) and ``cards: {card_id: {escalated, creator_escalated}}``
  (the per-card escalation latches). Owner entries are pruned when the owner
  has no stale cards; card entries are pruned when the card leaves the stale
  set (so a future stall re-escalates on either latch).
* Recipient keying matches the producer/dispatch convention
  (:func:`scitex_todo._notify._resolver._resolve_name_to_id`).
* Pure-ish + injectable: ``enqueue``, ``resolve_key``, ``resolve_user`` and
  ``now`` are injectable so tests drive the cadence/escalation/liveness state
  machine with real fakes (no mocks, no network, no clock).
