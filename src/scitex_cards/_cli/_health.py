"""CLI verb ``scitex-cards health`` — the package-level health doctor.

A BROAD store / identity / delivery health check (distinct from
``scitex-cards mcp doctor``, which only checks the fastmcp install). Thin
wrapper over :func:`scitex_cards._health.health`: it prints a human-readable
report by default, or the raw standard-shape JSON with ``--json``.

Exit code mirrors health: ``0`` when every check is ok, ``1`` otherwise — so
``scitex-cards health`` is usable as a shell gate / CI probe.
