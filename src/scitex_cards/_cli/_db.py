"""CLI noun group ``scitex-cards db`` — SQLite operability verbs.

SQLite is the store. These verbs are its operability surface:

  * ``db path``     — print the resolved database path.
  * ``db verify``   — open the DB, check user_version + table counts.
  * ``db export``   — write the store out as YAML text (a backup, never a source).
  * ``db snapshot`` — export + git-commit the export off-site.

The YAML-import verbs (``db import --from-yaml``, ``db rehearse``, and
``db snapshot --refresh``) are DELETED: there is no YAML to import from, and an
importer built on the DB read path rebuilt the database from itself.

The group token is a NOUN per the SciTeX noun-verb CLI convention. Attached to
the root group via :func:`register`.
