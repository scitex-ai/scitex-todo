"""The WIP gate's ENFORCEMENT half — the add-path decision, in one place.

``_throughput.py`` owns the MEASUREMENT (``count_wip_for_agent`` /
:class:`~scitex_cards._throughput.WipReport` / ``is_warn`` / ``is_refuse``).
This module owns what the writer DOES with that measurement, so the policy —
including the emergency-recording exemption below — is readable in one screen
instead of buried inline in ``_store.add_task``. Consumed by ``_store.py`` the
same way ``_store_enums`` / ``_store_verify`` are.

WHY THE EXEMPTION EXISTS (incident 2026-07-12)
----------------------------------------------
The operator escalated a P0 (fleet-wide config/state-loss hazard). The agent
went to CARD it. The board REFUSED::

    Error: WIP gate refuses add: scitex-hub already has 40 open tasks
    (>= 2 × limit 20). Close existing tasks before adding more.

The incident was then buried as a comment on an unrelated card — the worst
outcome for the one class of card that most needs to be findable.

A WIP cap is a THROUGHPUT-SHAPING device and it was sitting on the
EMERGENCY-RECORDING path. Those have opposite requirements. "Your board is
untidy" must never mean "you may not record that production is on fire."

Worse, the perverse incentive: under outage pressure the cheapest way past the
gate is to CLOSE CARDS YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED. A cap that pressures agents to
falsify card state during an emergency is worse than no cap — and the old
refusal text ("Close existing tasks before adding more") said so out loud.

THE RULE
--------
A card at ``priority <= 1`` is NEVER gated. No flag to remember, no thinking
required mid-outage: filing a P0/P1 simply works.

* Priority is LOWER = MORE URGENT (the CLI: "Integer priority (lower =
  earlier)"). On the live store, 21 of 28 incident cards are priority 1 — so
  the predicate is ``<= 1``, not ``>= 8``.
* The exemption keys on PRIORITY and deliberately NOT on a new ``kind`` enum
  value. ``kind`` is a CLOSED enum (task / compute / decision / status) and
  agents still running 0.7.50 have no tolerant reader — one unknown value
  aborts the whole store load for them. That is exactly the 2026-07-10 fleet
  outage. Deploy-order rule: tolerant reader fleet-wide FIRST, new enum value
  SECOND. ``priority`` is an open integer field and needs neither.
* The bypass is LOUD, not silent: a card admitted over the refuse threshold is
  stamped with an audit comment naming the agent's WIP count and the limit
  (:func:`_override_comment`). Abuse is therefore self-reporting, and we can
  MEASURE whether P1 gets inflated once agents learn the rule. A silent bypass
  would be its own silent-absence bug.
