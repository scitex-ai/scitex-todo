"""Stop-hook idle guard — refuse to let an agent abandon claimed work.

INCIDENT (operator, 2026-06-30, SERIOUS): "agents stop even with their card not
completed yet." The board is the fleet's direction system; an agent that marks a
card ``in_progress`` and then silently stops without finishing, reassigning, or
explicitly blocking it is the abandonment this guard prevents — DETERMINISTICALLY
(constitution: deterministic systems over agentic; hooks over prompts).

Mechanism
---------
A Claude Code **Stop hook** runs ``python -m scitex_todo._idle_guard``. If the
agent owns a STALE ``in_progress`` card (claimed but untouched past the
stale-active threshold), the hook BLOCKS the stop (exit code 2) and tells the
agent EXACTLY how to clear it: finish it, reassign it, or set it ``blocked`` with
a blocker + a comment. Those are the only honest dispositions — none of them is
"silently stop". When the agent acts, the card leaves the stale set and the guard
allows the stop, so the loop is bounded by genuine disposition, not by force.

Why STALE ``in_progress`` specifically (not all open cards)
-----------------------------------------------------------
* PENDING backlog is surfaced by the recurring digest nudge, not the stop guard —
  blocking stop on a whole backlog would trap an agent that legitimately has many
  queued cards.
* A freshly-TOUCHED ``in_progress`` card means the agent is actively working and
  is not the abandonment case (it will not be stopping mid-keystroke).
* A ``blocked`` card is a legitimate park (waiting on operator/dependency).

So the abandonment signal is precisely: **claimed (``in_progress``) + not
progressing (stale) + trying to stop.** That reuses the SAME detector the nag
engine + freshness campaign use (:func:`scitex_todo._stale_active.detect_stale_active`).

Wiring (the fleet-wide enforcement)
-----------------------------------
Add a Stop hook to each agent's Claude settings so the guard runs whenever the
agent tries to go idle (``SCITEX_TODO_AGENT`` + ``SCITEX_TODO_TASKS_YAML_SHARED`` are already
in the agent's env)::

    "hooks": {
      "Stop": [
        {"hooks": [{"type": "command",
                    "command": "/uvwork/venv-agent/bin/python -m scitex_todo._idle_guard"}]}
      ]
    }

Exit 2 blocks the stop and feeds the reason back to the agent; exit 0 lets it
stop. Pair it with the recurring digest nudge (notifyd, owner-allowlist) — the
digest RE-ENGAGES an idle agent with its assigned-card list, the Stop hook
PREVENTS a silent stop with claimed work. Together they are the deterministic
"never idle while tasks remain" enforcement (constitution §4).

Fail-soft
---------
A bug in the guard must NEVER permanently trap an agent: any unexpected error is
logged to stderr and the guard ALLOWS the stop (exit 0). It fails loud but open.
