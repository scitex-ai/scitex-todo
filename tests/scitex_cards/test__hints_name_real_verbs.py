"""A hint must be runnable as printed. This proves the verbs in ours exist.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-22). ``sac`` found that ``enforce_ripgrep.sh`` — the
most-fired guard in the fleet container — blocks ``grep -r`` and steers agents
to two remedies that are both unavailable there, so an agent who fully complies
with the guardrail has nowhere correct to go. Applying that rule to our own
surface immediately found the same defect, in a worse place: two health hints
told the reader to run ``scitex-cards db import``, and the ``db`` group has no
``import`` subcommand. Both fire on the STORE IS BROKEN path — the moment the
reader most needs a correct next step.

The promise was worse than the name. "seed from an export" has no CLI surface
at all; recovery from a dump is a Python-level operation. A broken-store agent
was handed an unrunnable command AND a recovery route that does not exist.

WHY THE POSITIVE CONTROL BELOW IS LOAD-BEARING, and not ceremony. The obvious
version of this test — enumerate the CLI, assert every hinted verb is in it —
passes trivially if the enumeration returns nothing. That is the exact failure
this whole class is about: an instrument reporting success while measuring
nothing (``rg`` exits 0 and prints zero matches; a divergence checker skips
1,145 files and prints a confident total). So the control asserts that verbs we
KNOW exist are found, before any hint is judged. If enumeration breaks, the
control fails loudly instead of the suite going green over an unchecked claim.

    PARSED WITH ``ast``, NOT MATCHED WITH A REGEX, and that is the whole point.
    The first version of this file scanned RAW SOURCE for `` `...` `` with a
    pattern that forbade newlines. Hint bodies are adjacent string literals
    inside a parenthesised expression, so where the line happens to wrap decides
    whether a hint is visible — a factor with nothing to do with correctness.

    It shipped a live example: `scitex-cards db import` in
    ``_check_store_identity_agrees``, whose backticks straddled two concatenated
    f-strings. The guard was green while the dead verb it was written to catch
    was still printing, in the same file, on the total-write-outage path.

    ``ast`` resolves adjacent-literal concatenation before this ever sees the
    text, so wrapping cannot hide anything. f-strings arrive as ``JoinedStr``;
    their literal segments are read and the ``{...}`` holes are rendered as a
    placeholder, which is right for this purpose — a runtime-interpolated value
