# Heuristic pinned in HANDOFF.md: ANY schema evolution touches the dataclass
# FIRST; validator + adapters follow mechanically. Two-sources-of-truth is

#
# Back-compat: existing dict-style consumers (handlers/graph.py, _store.py,
# the MCP layer) keep working — `Task.from_dict()` reads any historical
# task shape, `Task.to_dict()` round-trips to a dict the existing writers
# can consume. The migration to attribute-style access is incremental per

    Field layout follows the operator's co-design (TG 9667, lead a2a

    (`id` / `title` / `task` / `project` / `host` / `created_at` /
    `goal`), then the UI-driving + workflow fields (`status` / `agent` /
    `last_activity` / `blocker` / `pr_url` / `issue_url`), then the
    graph-wiring fields preserved from pre-PR-#52 (`depends_on` / `blocks`
    / `parent` / `priority` / `note` / `comments`), then the kind
    discriminator + compute metadata (ADR-0002 / 0003), then the legacy
    shared-fleet additive fields (`scope` / `assignee` / `_log_meta`).

    Construction: prefer :meth:`Task.from_dict` for loading from a YAML
    row — it handles legacy spellings (e.g. `blocker: "dep"` → canonical
    `"dependency"`), missing fields (filled with the dataclass default),
    and ignores unknown keys defensively (so a forward-compat YAML with
    a future field doesn't crash an older loader).

    Persistence: :meth:`to_dict` round-trips to the dict shape the
    ruamel writer in :func:`save_tasks` expects. Fields with default
    values (None / empty list / empty dict) are OMITTED from the dict
    so the YAML stays compact. Required fields (id, title) are always
    emitted.
