"""Built-in event handlers for the hook bus.

Split out of the original flat ``_hooks.py`` (C2 refactor). Holds the
idempotent built-in handlers for the ``push`` / ``done`` / ``unblock``
kinds plus their dedupe helpers. Logic is byte-for-byte the original —
C2 changed only the validator + the plugin runner.

There is intentionally NO ``card-event`` built-in handler here: C2
keeps scope to bus mechanics, so a validated ``card-event`` flows
straight to plugins (the built-in card-event handler is C5).
