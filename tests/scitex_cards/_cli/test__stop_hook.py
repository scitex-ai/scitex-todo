"""``scitex-cards stop-hook`` — refuses a stop while the board holds work.

The cards half of the never-stop-when-task-remains mechanism (ADR-0012). The
runtime registers this into ``.claude/settings.json`` and knows nothing about
its output; cards owns both ends of the contract, so the format below is the
whole public surface.

CONTRACT: stdout is Claude Code Stop-hook JSON.
``{"decision": "block", "reason": ...}`` refuses the stop and feeds ``reason``
back as the agent's NEXT INSTRUCTION. ``{}`` allows it.

Pinned here, with real store files and no mocks:
* work remains → block, and the reason NAMES the cards and says what to do;
* board empty → allow;
* detector failure → ALLOW (fail-open), because an agent wedged by our own bug
  is worse than one that stopped early;
* another agent's work does not block this agent;
* the reason stays bounded when the board is large — an instruction listing
  forty cards is not an instruction.
