"""A deadline is a VIEW, never a notifier — pin the contract.

scitex-cards accepts a `deadline` with an org-style recurring repeater
(`+1d` / `+1w` / `+1m` / `+1y`), and the repeater genuinely rolls the next
occurrence forward. Agents therefore read "recurring deadline" as "this will
remind me periodically". IT WILL NOT. Two separate truths, both pinned here
because both are DOC-level promises a doc could silently break:

1. NO DEADLINE EVER NOTIFIES. The notification surface never reads a
   deadline. An owned card whose deadline has passed but whose
   ``last_activity`` is fresh yields NO nudge; the same card gone quiet DOES.
   Nudges track INACTIVITY. Deleting the deadline outright does not change
   the sweep's output at all — it is not an input.

2. A RECURRING DEADLINE IS NEVER EVEN *OVERDUE*. Precisely because the
   repeater rolls forward, the next occurrence is always in the FUTURE — so
   ``overdue=True`` NEVER matches a recurring card, at any ``now``, for
   either the `+` or the `++` form. Only a NON-recurring deadline can go
   overdue. So a recurring deadline drives neither rail: it notifies nobody
   AND it never surfaces in the overdue filter. It is a date-pill.

The structural guard at the bottom fails if a delivery module ever starts
reading a deadline (a real, queued proposal — card
``todo-recurring-deadline-does-not-nudge-docs-lie-20260712``), forcing the
docs to be corrected in the same breath.

No mocks — real dicts + a frozen ``now``, per STX-NM / PA-306.
