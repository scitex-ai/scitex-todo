# WHY a layered install (not the bare PYTHONPATH=src trick scitex-dev uses):
# the shared ci-cpu.sif bakes scitex-dev[all,dev] DEPS, NOT scitex-todo's —
# matplotlib / graphviz / seaborn / django / Pillow / networkx / playwright /
# pytesseract / scitex-app / scitex-ui are absent from the SIF. So we install
# THIS checkout + its [all,dev] extras (WITH dependency resolution) into a
# writable --target dir and prepend that on PYTHONPATH. The SIF still supplies
# the heavy shared base (pip/uv, the python interpreters, scitex-dev's deps),
# so only scitex-todo's own thin dep set is fetched per run.
#
# --target (not a plain `-e .`): the SIF's /opt/venv-* are root-owned + RO and
# the HPC compute-node HOME is RO inside the container, so a normal site install
# fails Permission denied. A writable target on node-local /tmp sidesteps both.
#
# Fail-loud: a missing interpreter or a failed install is a hard error.

# tagged commit. Full `-n <all-cores>` xdist saturates the node and STARVES the
# suite's concurrency tests that spawn their own subprocesses — e.g.
# test_two_concurrent_writers_serialize_via_flock (30s subprocess timeout) and
# the comment turn-URL timing test — which then time out non-deterministically
# and blocked the v0.7.29 release even though the gate was green on the same
# commit. Single-process removes that contention; the gate already parallelises
# CI throughput across the 3 matrix legs, so the release re-test just needs to
# be reliable, not fast.
