"""The store's READ / QUERY surface: ``list_tasks``, ``summarize_tasks``, ``_match``.

Extracted from :mod:`scitex_cards._store`, which had grown to 1,645 lines around two
unrelated jobs — the WRITE surface (add / update / complete / delete / comment, the
locked read-modify-write cycle, enum gating, event emission) and this, the read
surface. They share nothing but a store path, and the read surface is the half that
the fleet hits on every poll. ``_store`` re-exports every name defined here, so no
caller had to move.

SQLite IS the store (see :mod:`scitex_cards._store_backend`) — there is no other
backend and no way to select one. :func:`list_tasks` always reads through
:func:`scitex_cards._model.load_tasks`, which reads the canonical database via
:func:`scitex_cards._store._read_canonical_db_or_raise`. An unresolvable or
unreadable store RAISES with an actionable message; there is no YAML chain and no
bundled example left to fall back to (both were deleted 2026-07-19/21).

This module used to also dispatch to a second, SQLite-indexed read path
(``_store_read_sqlite`` — S2) when a set of runtime checks passed, and fell back to
this Python-predicate path otherwise. That accelerator is DELETED (2026-07-21
incident): now that SQLite is canonical rather than a mirror, its freshness guard
compared the DB's provenance stamp against a YAML file that no longer exists, so it
refused to serve and fell back — and that fallback resolved to an empty bundled
example, silently serving a blank board while claiming reads were merely slow. A
mirror that can never again pass its own freshness check is not a slow path, it is
dead code that fails dangerous. One read path, always exercised, always through the
same ownership-guarded reader.
