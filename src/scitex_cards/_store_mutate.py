"""The insert / update half of the store's write surface.

Split out of ``_store`` (PURE MOVE — no behaviour change), which re-exports
every name below so ``from ._store import add_task`` keeps working:

    add_task            Append a new task (owner + creator FAIL-LOUD, WIP gate).
    update_task         Mutate fields of an existing task by id.
    _stamp_deferred_at  Stamp the backlog age clock on ENTRY into `deferred`.
    _wip_statuses       Back-compat re-export of ``_throughput.WIP_STATUSES``.

Named ``_store_mutate`` rather than ``_store_write`` because ``_store_write``
is ALREADY the low-level persistence layer (``_store_lock`` / ``save_tasks`` /
``_save_doc_unlocked``) that this module writes THROUGH.

The shared helpers (``_read_write_doc`` / ``_utc_now_iso`` /
``_resolve_creator_or_raise`` / ``ENV_AGENT`` / ``TaskNotFoundError``) stay in
``_store`` and are imported HERE inside the function bodies — a deferred
import, because ``_store`` imports this module at module level to re-export
its verbs and a top-level import back would cycle. Same pattern the code
already used for ``from . import _model``.
