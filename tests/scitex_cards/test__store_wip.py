"""End-to-end tests for ``scitex_cards._store_wip`` — the WIP gate's add-path
enforcement, and the emergency-recording exemption it now carries.

Real stores on disk, real ``add_task`` (no mocks; STX-NM / PA-306). AAA +
one-assertion-per-test (STX-TQ002 / STX-TQ007).

The incident these pin (2026-07-12): the operator escalated a P0 and the board
REFUSED the card — "WIP gate refuses add: … Close existing tasks before adding
more." A throughput cap was sitting on the emergency-recording path, and its
cheapest workaround was to close cards you had not finished. Priority <= 1 is
now never gated; a card admitted over the cap says so, on the card.
