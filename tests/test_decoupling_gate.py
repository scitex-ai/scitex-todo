"""S7 decoupling gate: scitex-cards never couples to sac or the telegrammer.

Operator hard rule (さいいんふら, 2026-07-16): scitex-cards must be
independently usable — no single point of failure, no import of
scitex-agent-container (sac) or claude-code-telegrammer, ever. Cross-package
integration happens through PORTS (entry-point groups the OTHER side
registers into; see ``_ports.py``), so the dependency arrow always points
AT this package, never out of it.

Two layers, because each catches what the other cannot:

* the AST scan proves no module TEXT contains a forbidden import — including
  imports hidden inside functions (lazy imports), which a runtime probe only
  catches if the function runs;
* the runtime probe proves the exercised CRUD surface still WORKS when those
  packages are absent — the no-single-point-of-failure half of the rule,
  which no amount of source reading can establish.

The runtime probe deliberately does NOT assert "no forbidden module is in
``sys.modules``". A port PROVIDER loading is the design succeeding, not
failing: sac registers a handler into our ``scitex_todo.hooks`` group, so a
write legitimately imports ``scitex_agent_container`` via ``ep.load()``. The
arrow still points at us — we never name it. Asserting on ``sys.modules``
flagged that as a violation and failed on correct code (2026-07-22).

    FAILURE: scitex-cards must work when those packages are absent. So assert
