"""Board service -- resolve + load the ONE canonical task store, with a cache.

Mirrors figrecipe's ``services.get_or_create_editor`` shape but read-only: the
board never mutates the store in this MVP, so the "board" is just the validated
task list plus its resolved path and a content signature. The cache avoids
re-loading the store on every poll while still picking up external edits.

Single canonical store (SQLite cutover)
---------------------------------------
SQLite is the only store. :func:`scitex_cards._model.load_tasks` reads the ONE
canonical DB (``resolve_db_path(None)``) and ignores the path argument, so the
board no longer globs per-project YAML lanes and unions them — every "source"
would read the same DB. The board therefore loads exactly one store.

Cache invalidation keys on the DB's logical CONTENT version
(:func:`scitex_cards._store_write.store_generation`), not the store-identity
file's stat: a DB write never touches that file, so an mtime/inode key would
never invalidate and the board would serve a pre-write snapshot (reorder
priorities, refresh, still see the old order). ``store_generation`` is
read-stable (it hashes the logical document, not the ``.db`` bytes that WAL
rewrites on a plain read), so it changes on any card/user change and only then.
See :class:`BoardState`.

    Pairing the stamp with the SIZE is what makes this survive a filesystem
    with 1-second timestamp granularity, where a write and the stat after it
    can report the same mtime. See ``BoardState.sig``.

    SIZE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, and it is worth being exact about why rather
    than claiming this closes the hole: ``st_mtime_ns`` is nanosecond-TYPED,
    not nanosecond-ACCURATE — on a filesystem that stamps whole seconds the
    sub-second digits are simply zero. So (mtime_ns, size) still collides for
    a SAME-LENGTH edit inside one granule: flipping a priority ``1`` -> ``2``,
    or swapping a status for another of equal length, rewrites the file
    without moving either component.

    INODE closes that. Every write to this store lands via atomic
    ``os.replace`` of a freshly-written temp file, which allocates a NEW
    inode — so the inode changes on every write regardless of what the clock
    or the length did. Inode numbers can be recycled, so this is not a
    guarantee in the abstract; but a collision would need the same timestamp
    granule AND an identical size AND a recycled inode at once.

    NEVER RAISES. A lane can be deleted between being loaded and being
    fingerprinted, and the board must not 500 because a file went away — the
    surrounding code is deliberately per-lane fail-soft and this has to match
    it. A vanished file yields ``(0, 0, 0)``, which DIFFERS from whatever it
    was, so the cache correctly invalidates instead of pinning the old board.
