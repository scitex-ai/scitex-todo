"""`health` reports when the store and the DB's stamp disagree.

The store identity lives in two places — the launcher env and the DB's
provenance stamp — with nothing keeping them in step. A mismatch makes the
ownership guard refuse EVERY write, correctly, but the symptom is a total write
outage with no monitor.

On 2026-07-19 the MCP server resolved ~/.scitex/cards/tasks.yaml (deleted during
the cutover) while the DB was stamped ~/.scitex/todo/tasks.yaml. Every write
through the surface other agents use was refused and nothing reported it:
`store_canonical` answers "does a parseable file exist there", not "can this
process write".
