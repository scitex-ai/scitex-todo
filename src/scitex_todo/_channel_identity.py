"""Agent-identity resolution for the scitex-todo channel server.

Answers "whose inbox does this channel drain?" — extracted from
:mod:`scitex_todo._mcp_channel` (which re-exports both functions for
back-compat) to keep that orchestrator under its line budget. Pure logic,
no MCP/session coupling: precedence-based resolution with a fail-loud policy
and deprecated-env-var tolerance.

    Precedence: explicit ``arg`` → ``$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID``. Deliberately does
    NOT fall back to ``getpass.getuser()`` / ``"unknown"`` — a channel server
    that drains "unknown"'s inbox would silently deliver the wrong agent's
    notifications. The operator mandate (constitution rule 2 "fail fast and
    fail loud, NO silent fallbacks") requires a real identity here.

    Deprecated-var tolerance: the CURRENT var WINS. When ``arg`` /
    ``$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_ID`` yields a valid id we return it even if the stale
    ``$SCITEX_TODO_AGENT`` is also exported — we only log a loud warning that
