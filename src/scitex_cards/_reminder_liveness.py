"""Owner-liveness + creator-resolution helpers for the reminder engine.

Slice 3 of the delivery rail: when a stale card's OWNER (assignee) is not
alive, the assignee will never act, so the card escalates to its CREATOR.
These helpers wrap :func:`scitex_cards._users.is_alive` /
:func:`scitex_cards._users.resolve_user` and stay fail-soft — a registry
lookup error must NEVER break a sweep (an unresolvable owner is a dead owner
for escalation purposes). Extracted from :mod:`scitex_cards._reminders` (the
sweep state machine) so that module stays under the file-size budget.
