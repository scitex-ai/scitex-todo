"""CRUD handlers — create / update / comment on a task in the YAML store.

These extend the first write path (``priority``) to full create/update/delete
driven by the board's right-click menu and editable detail drawer (delete /
restore live in ``undo.py``, edges in ``edge.py`` — 512-line file cap).

NO handler may read ``board.tasks`` (a request-scoped CACHE, and a UNION of
the global store + per-project lanes), mutate it in memory, and save the
whole list back: any concurrent write landing between the cache read and the
save is silently clobbered (lost update), and the stale union gets absorbed
into the global store. Every write here DELEGATES to a locked ``_store``
verb (``add_task`` / ``update_task`` / ``comment_task``), which holds the
store flock across its own fresh read-modify-write. ``board.tasks`` is used
only for read-only fast-paths (404 checks, the id-collision scan on create).

Field set mirrors the task model: ``id`` + ``title`` + ``status`` (required)
and optional ``repo`` / ``depends_on`` / ``blocks`` / ``note`` / ``priority``
/ ``parent``. The store validator is the single validation gate, so a bad
mutation surfaces as a 400 rather than corrupting the store.
