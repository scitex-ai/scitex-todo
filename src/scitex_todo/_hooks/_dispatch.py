"""Top-level event dispatch for the hook bus.

Split out of the original flat ``_hooks.py`` (C2 refactor). Wires the
built-in per-kind handler (:mod:`._handlers`) + the bounded entry-point
plugin runner (:mod:`._plugins`) and returns the summary dict that the
HTTP / CLI wrappers send back to producers.

The return-summary SHAPE is unchanged from the original module — callers
+ HTTP/CLI responses depend on it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event : dict
        Already-validated event (call :func:`event_validate` first).
    store : Path-like, optional
        Override the task-store path; ``None`` resolves via the
        normal precedence chain.
    entry_points : iterable, optional
        Explicit set of plugin entry points to run instead of the ones
        discovered from packaging metadata. Each item must be entry-
        point-shaped: a ``.name`` attribute and a ``.load()`` method
        returning the handler callable. ``None`` (the default) reads the
        real ``scitex_todo.hooks`` group. This is the in-process
        injection seam (mirrors scitex-dev's
        ``load_plugins(entry_points_iter=...)``): in-process producers
        that can't ship packaging metadata, and tests that need a real
        fake handler, pass a concrete list here — no monkeypatch of
        ``importlib.metadata`` required (PA-306-compliant).
