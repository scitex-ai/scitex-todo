"""The DETECT side of the notifyd loop — the sweeps that feed delivery.

:mod:`scitex_cards._delivery._daemon` owns the loop (single-instance lock,
signals, delivery ticks); this module owns the two things that RUN inside a
tick but are not delivery:

* :func:`_run_reminder_sweep` — every tick: enqueue any DUE owner digests +
  escalations (:func:`scitex_cards._reminders.sweep_reminders`) so the SAME
  tick's ``deliver_pending`` sends them.
* :func:`_run_stale_nudge_sweep` — on its OWN, much slower cadence
  (:data:`ENV_NUDGE_SWEEP_MINUTES`): the fleet-liveness sweep
  (:func:`scitex_cards._stale_active_nudge.sweep_and_nudge`). It scans the whole
  store, so it has no business in the 60 s delivery path. Until this landed the
  sweep had NO scheduled caller at all (only the interactive ``print-stats``
  verb), so idle owners were never nudged. Like the reminder sweep it ENQUEUES
  into each owner's pull-inbox (it used to push on the turn-url wire, which is
  unprovisioned for nearly every agent — so once scheduled it reached NOBODY).

Both READ the store and release it — no lock is held across a sweep (a
lock-holding sweep in this loop is what produced the store-lock convoy) — and
both are FULLY GUARDED: an exception is logged and swallowed so a bad sweep can
never kill the always-on delivery loop.
