"""Channel discovery over the ``scitex_todo.delivery_channels`` group.

Mirrors the shape of scitex-dev's ``discover_jobs`` federated loader
(``scitex_dev._core.discovery`` / ``scitex_dev.jobs``): discover providers
via ``importlib.metadata.entry_points``, load each, dedup by channel name,
return a DETERMINISTIC (name-sorted) result, and SKIP-AND-WARN (never
silently swallow) any provider that fails to load — fail-loud to stderr.

The entry-point group name is deliberately ``scitex_todo.delivery_channels``
— distinct from any ``scitex_agent_container.*`` group — so the two fleets'
channel registries never collide. This module has ZERO sac imports.

Test seam
---------
:func:`discover_channels` takes an ``extra_providers=`` parameter so tests
inject REAL fake channel instances (a recorder, a flaky raiser) WITHOUT
touching installed entry points and WITHOUT any mock. Injected channels are
deduped + ordered with discovered ones under the same first-wins policy.
