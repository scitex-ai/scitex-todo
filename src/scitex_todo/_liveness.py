"""scitex-todo's OWN liveness signal at the store boundary.

Two thin wrappers over :mod:`scitex_todo._users` that the mutating store
verbs (create / comment / update / reassign / inbox-poll) call:

    _heartbeat            Stamp ``last_seen = now(UTC)`` on the ACTING agent's
                          registry record (fail-soft — never breaks the write).
    _assignee_liveness    Classify a card's ASSIGNEE as alive / stale / unknown
                          so an assign can tell the caller "you just assigned
                          to a non-running agent."

STANDALONE constraint (SoC mandate): liveness is computed PURELY from
scitex-todo's own registry record's ``last_seen`` — stamped locally, read
locally. There is NO ``sac`` / ``scitex_agent_container`` import and NO
network probe to any external runtime here or anywhere it reaches.

These live OUTSIDE ``_store.py`` (already grandfathered over the line cap)
so the SSOT store only gains thin call lines, not net-new logic.

    it must never break or roll back the user's action. An unregistered actor
