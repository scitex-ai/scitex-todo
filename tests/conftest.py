"""THE TEST SUITE CANNOT REACH THE LIVE STORE. Enforced here, not by discipline.

On 2026-07-19 this suite rebuilt the fleet's production database from its own
fixtures THREE TIMES in one session:

    2,136 cards -> 21     (mirror write path)
    2,138 cards -> 1      (canonical write path)
    2,138 cards -> 3      (canonical read path, via one `comment_task`)

All three were recovered from the snapshot repo's git history. All three had
the same enabling condition, and it is not any of the three bugs that were
fixed afterwards: **a test that never sets ``$SCITEX_CARDS_DB``**. With the
variable unset, ``resolve_db_path(None)`` walks its precedence chain to the
user-canonical path — which IS the real board — and every in-code ownership
guard then sees a perfectly legitimate write to the store it was told to use.
No guard can refuse that, because from inside the code there is nothing wrong
with it.

So the barrier belongs HERE, in the harness, above the code under test. A rule
enforced inside the thing being tested cannot bound the damage that thing can
do; a rule in the harness cannot be reached by any future change to resolution
order, precedence, backend selection, or env compat.

WHY ``autouse`` + ``session`` + ``os.environ`` RATHER THAN ``monkeypatch``:
the pinning must be in place before the first test imports ``scitex_cards``
(``_env_compat.mirror_env()`` runs at import time and reads the environment),
and it must also be inherited by SUBPROCESSES — the concurrency tests pass
``env=os.environ.copy()`` to real child processes, which is precisely how the
first wipe happened. ``monkeypatch`` is per-test and would leave the gap open
during collection and in any test that forgets it.

Per-test overrides still work exactly as before: a test that sets ``ENV_DB``
via ``monkeypatch.setenv`` shadows this for its own duration. This fixture only
supplies a SAFE DEFAULT where there previously was a dangerous one.

#: ``SCITEX_TODO_DB`` to exercise that fallback (see
#: ``tests/scitex_cards/test__paths.py``'s ``clean_store_env`` fixture, which

# CURRENCY gate suppression (scitex_cards._currency.check_currency, wired at
# the CLI group callback + MCP server import). The test suite needs it:
# `pytest-matrix` CI checks out a PR merge ref into an EDITABLE install, so
# scitex-dev's `ensure_current` sees this checkout as "N commits behind its
# own remote" (true, and harmless — the runner just hasn't fast-forwarded a
# ref it will never push to) and, without suppression, raises. Every test
# that invokes the CLI (`CliRunner` -> `main()`) or imports `_mcp_server`
# would otherwise fail on a condition that has nothing to do with the code
# under test — CI incident 2026-07-21, PR #550.
#
# TWO KNOBS, because they answer different questions:
#   - `SCITEX_DEV_NO_CURRENCY_GATE=1` — downgrades a would-be raise to a WARN
#     (documented in `ensure_current`'s own error text). By itself this still
#     PRINTS, which broke a second test asserting the CLI's `--json` output
#     is pure JSON (the warn landed on stdout ahead of the JSON payload).
#   - `SCITEX_DEV_CURRENCY_SEVERITY=silent` — the severity ladder (explicit
#     call-site arg > this env var > scitex-dev's own default knob); silent
#     means the check still runs but neither raises nor prints anything.
# Both are pinned so the suite is silent regardless of which one scitex-dev
# ends up honoring for a given call path; neither weakens the gate outside
# the test harness — a real CLI/MCP invocation (these vars unset) still
# errors loudly on a stale/broken install exactly as designed.

    silently hand the NEXT test the user-canonical default — the live board.
    Restoring it every test keeps the guarantee for the whole session rather

    (2) A FRESH DATABASE PER TEST, which is new and is what the cutover
    requires. A single session-wide database cannot serve this suite: the store
    carries an identity, and a test that passes its own ``tmp_path`` store is
    refused by a database already stamped for a different one — correctly, since
    writing store A into store B's database replaces B's rows with A's. Sharing
    one database between tests would therefore either break them or force the
    ownership guard off, and the guard is the thing that stopped this suite
    rebuilding the fleet's production database three times on 2026-07-19.

    Per-test isolation removes the collision instead of arbitrating it, and it
    buys real isolation as a side effect: no test can observe another's rows.

    ``env=os.environ.copy()`` to real child processes, and those children must
