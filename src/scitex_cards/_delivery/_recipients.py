"""Per-user delivery config + the delivery POLICY gate.

Reads ``<store_dir>/recipients.json`` (a sibling of the task store), which
maps each user to the channels they should be delivered on::

    {"users": {
       "u_3f9a1c0b7e42": {"channels": [
         {"kind": "log"},
         {"kind": "telegram", "address": "123456789"}]},
       "dave": {"channels": [{"kind": "log"}]}}}

``address`` is OPTIONAL (the ``log`` channel needs none). A missing file
yields an empty recipient set (no crash) — delivery simply has nothing to
do. A pre-JSON ``recipients.yaml`` is converted to JSON ONCE on first access
(see :mod:`scitex_cards._legacy_yaml_migration`), after which the read is
JSON-only. Resolution follows the same store precedence via
:func:`scitex_cards._inbox._resolved_store`.

Policy lives HERE, never inside a channel: :func:`should_deliver_now` is the
SEAM where quiet-hours / consent / rate-limit will hang off. Slice 1 returns
True (no-op), but the loop MUST call it and a False result yields a
``skipped`` outcome (re-evaluated next run, never terminal).
