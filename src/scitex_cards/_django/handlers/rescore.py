"""Rescore handler — a matrix-view drag sets a card's two axes.

ADR-0011 §8: humans DRAG a card in the urgency×importance matrix to update
its axes; the rank engine recomputes the whole order server-side and the new
order is immediately shared with agents. This handler is the HTTP entry for
that drag.

It owns NO logic of its own — it DELEGATES to the locked ``rescore_task``
store verb (fresh read-modify-write under the store flock), which is the only
writer of ``rank`` and the only emitter of the ``rank_changed`` card-event. A
handler-local flock write would be atomic but EVENTLESS — invisible to agents
— so the re-score must go through the verb (the decisive finding on card
``scitex-cards-gui-matrix-view-20260717``).

Rank is COMPUTED, never asserted (ADR-0011 §1): the client sends only the two
axis values it dropped a card onto; the server computes rank. Axes are
validated 1..5 fail-loud by the verb (a bad axis surfaces as 400).
