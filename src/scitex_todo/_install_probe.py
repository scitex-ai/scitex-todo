"""Verify a package's REAL version BY CONTENT — never by the version string alone.

WHY THIS EXISTS (incident 2026-07-12)
-------------------------------------
``importlib.metadata.version(dist)`` reads the ``.dist-info`` directory. That
directory can OUTLIVE the code it describes, and then it lies — confidently,
permanently, and with nothing anywhere reporting a problem:

* scitex-todo's own container: an old ``pip install -e`` left an ORPHANED
  ``scitex_todo-0.7.26.dist-info`` in site-packages with NO package files beside
  it, plus a path entry pointing at the live repo. The CODE loaded fresh from the
  working tree (0.8.7); the VERSION reported 0.7.26. Thirty releases apart.
* sac's container, independently: the BAKED dist-info reports a fossil while the
  code is bind-mounted from host source and current.
* 2026-07-10: a subagent's editable install DELETED ``site-packages/scitex_todo``
  and repointed the venv at its worktree. The dist-info stayed — so every version
  check reported a healthy install *with no code behind it*.

The fleet's drift detector (``scitex-dev ecosystem check-versions``, named in the
constitution) reads that exact string. **A drift detector reading a fossilised
version is a drift detector turned off**: it cries "stale, needs deploy" forever
on a container that is current, or blesses a genuinely stale one whose metadata
happens to look right. It cannot distinguish the two.

This module is the fix: it reports what the CODE says, what the METADATA says,
and whether they agree — so a caller can never be fooled by the string alone.

THE THIRD FAILURE MODE — DISK TRUTH IS NOT PROCESS TRUTH
--------------------------------------------------------
**This probe reports what is on DISK. A long-lived process may be running
something else entirely, and no version number will ever tell you.**

Found by scitex-dev (2026-07-12) while checking a claim of mine — which is the
only reason it is written down here. Their symptom: an ``update_task`` call failed
for HOURS with an old-enum validator message. A mid-session ``pip install
--upgrade`` changed the code on disk, and the failures **continued,
byte-identical**. Only a full process restart cleared them.

The cause is neither pip nor the metadata. Python imports a module ONCE, into
``sys.modules``; upgrading the files on disk does not touch the module objects a
running process already holds. So a server can serve stale code from memory while
its disk, its ``.dist-info``, and this probe ALL agree the install is current —
and every one of them is telling the truth. They are simply answering a different
question than the one that was asked.

You cannot detect this from a version string. Not the metadata's, and not the
source's: both describe the DISK.

**The only reliable detector is to probe the LOADED MODULE for a symbol** — which
is exactly what ``features`` does, because ``hasattr`` reads ``sys.modules`` and
therefore interrogates the code the process is ACTUALLY RUNNING::

    p = probe_install("scitex-todo", features={
        "post_migration_enum": "scitex_todo._model:VALID_BLOCKERS",
    })
    if not p.features["post_migration_enum"]:
        # THIS PROCESS is running pre-migration code, whatever the disk says.
        # An upgrade will NOT fix it — only a RESTART will.

The rule: **to know what a process is running, ask the process — not the package
manager.** And when the answer is "stale", the remedy is a RESTART; an upgrade
will not touch it.

(A tempting shortcut — comparing the module file's mtime against the process
start time — was tried and DELIBERATELY NOT SHIPPED: it depends on boot-time
arithmetic and clock skew, and it gave a wrong answer on the first live box it
was pointed at. Shipping a flaky detector for a false-confidence bug would be
self-parody. Symbol probing is exact; use it.)

DESIGN
------
Pure, dependency-light, and **it never raises**: a probe that can crash is a
probe that gets wrapped in ``try/except`` and ignored. Every failure mode comes
back as a populated result with an actionable ``hint``, because a diagnostic that
fails silently is the very disease it is meant to detect.

The probe is generic — pass any distribution name. sac probes ``sac``, scitex-dev
probes the ecosystem; nothing here is scitex-todo-specific.
