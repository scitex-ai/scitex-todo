"""Edge handler — add / remove a dependency edge between two tasks.

Extracted from ``crud.py`` (512-line file cap). Delegates the write to the
locked :func:`scitex_cards._store.set_edge` verb: the old path read the
board's cached task list, mutated it in memory and saved the WHOLE list
back, so any concurrent write landing between the cache read and the save
was silently clobbered (lost update).

    """POST edge -> add or remove a dependency edge between two tasks.

    Body: ``{action: "add"|"remove", kind: "depends_on"|"blocks", source, target}``
    where ``source``/``target`` use the graph-payload orientation:
      - ``depends_on``: edge points dependency(source) -> dependent(target), so
        the field lives on ``target`` as ``target.depends_on += [source]``.
      - ``blocks``: edge points blocker(source) -> blocked(target), so the
        field lives on ``source`` as ``source.blocks += [target]``.

    Add is idempotent; remove drops the reference. Both endpoints validate that
    the two ids exist (404 otherwise). The write DELEGATES to
    :func:`scitex_cards._store.set_edge`, which ALSO subscribes the waiting
    card's owner to the card they wait on (the 2026-07-13 fix this GUI path
    had been silently missing). ``set_edge`` hangs the field on ITS ``source``,
    so for ``kind=depends_on`` the GUI payload's source/target are SWAPPED on
    the way in (the on-disk placement stays identical to the old handler's).
