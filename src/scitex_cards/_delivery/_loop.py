"""The delivery loop — read pending notifications, hand them to channels.

:func:`deliver_pending` is slice 1's one-shot delivery pass (the CLI
``scitex-cards deliver`` command + a future cron/loop runner call it). It is
the orchestrator that wires the parts together while honouring the hard
separation of concerns:

* READ-ONLY on the inbox — ``poll_inbox(unseen_only=False, mark_seen=False)``.
  The loop NEVER flips a user's ``seen`` cursor and NEVER calls ``ack``;
  ``seen`` is the USER's read state, totally separate from delivery state.
* The :class:`~scitex_cards._delivery._ledger.Ledger` is the SOLE delivery
  truth — it decides what's already sent / retry-due.
* :func:`~scitex_cards._delivery._recipients.should_deliver_now` is the policy
  gate (quiet-hours/consent); a False result is a NON-terminal ``skipped``.
* Fail-soft per item: a channel that RAISES is caught, recorded ``failed``
  (retryable), surfaced to stderr, and never stops the other items.
