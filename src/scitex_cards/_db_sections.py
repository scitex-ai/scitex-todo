"""The NON-CARD sections of the shadow DB: users, notifications, messages.

Extracted from :mod:`scitex_cards._db_bootstrap`, which had grown to hold two
different jobs: the CARD pipeline (tasks + their comments / edges / roles, the
thing every hot path touches) and these three whole-section tables, which are
rebuilt only when their section hash moves (see :func:`_db_mirror._sync_sections`).

The ownership rule that governs this file, and that S1 nearly broke:

    A TABLE IS OWNED BY EXACTLY THE FILE THAT PRODUCES IT.

``users`` and ``notifications`` come from the ``tasks.yaml`` doc (its ``users:``
and ``inboxes:`` sections). ``messages`` does NOT — it is derived from the
``threads.yaml`` SIDECAR. A doc-write path that rebuilt ``messages`` would delete
every DM thread on every card write, which is why
:data:`_db_bootstrap._DOC_CLEAR_ORDER` excludes it.
