"""The store's WRITE PATH — locking, crash-safe save, optimistic concurrency.

Split out of :mod:`scitex_cards._model` (2026-07-12), which had grown to 1,566
lines by tangling two unrelated responsibilities:

* **the MODEL** — what a task IS: the ``Task`` dataclass, the closed enums, the
  validator, the deadline grammar, and the READ path. That stays in ``_model``.
* **the WRITE PATH** — how a task gets to DISK. That is this file.

The separation is not cosmetic. Every store incident of the past two weeks lived
in THIS code and nowhere else:

* the ~20 s whole-document round-trip write, O(whole-store) on every card change;
* the 2026-06-13 mid-string corruption, recovered by hand — now prevented by the
  tmp + fsync + ``os.replace`` dance and the post-dump reparse check below;
* the 2026-06-08 autoassign-parallel-run data loss (no atomic replace);
* and the LOCK CONVOY: MEASURED 2026-07-12 at **11,176 ms per card write** on the
  live 1,257-card store, while holding a FLEET-WIDE lock. Two agents writing means
  the second waits 11 seconds. That single number explains every "the board is
  slow" report we have ever had.

The lock is correct. What we do while holding it is not. This file is where that
gets fixed (see :mod:`scitex_cards._dual_write` and the SQLite migration), so it
deserves to be readable on its own rather than buried at the end of the model.

Every name here is re-exported from ``_model`` for backwards compatibility — 43
test files and every caller import from there, and the split must be invisible to
them.
