"""``scitex-todo`` command-line interface package.

Public entry point is ``main`` (wired to the ``scitex-todo`` console script).
The command tree is split across focused modules:

    _main         root group + core verbs (render-graph, list-tasks, board)
    _introspect   list-python-apis, mcp list-tools           (§1a)
    _completion   install-/print-shell-completion            (§1a)
    _skills       skills {list, get, install}                (§1a)
    _help_wait    help-wait / help-clear verbs

The bulk of the command tree is attached to ``main`` inside ``_main`` itself.
``help-wait`` / ``help-clear`` are wired here instead because ``_main`` and
``_write`` (the natural mutation-verb home) are both already at their line
budget — registering from this thin package root keeps the new verbs in a
focused module without a disruptive refactor of an unrelated oversized file.

# `install-stop-hook` — writes the four lines of settings.json that make the
# hook above actually run. Registration was the last MANUAL step between a
# merged mechanism and a live one, and a manual step is one that silently
# does not happen: the operator asked whether an agent with cards left could
# still stop, and it could, because nothing had wired it anywhere.
