"""A card blocked on a finished card is not blocked — it is unstarted.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-07-14): the store DOES drive the unblock —
`_store_events._emit_unblock_for_dependents` fires when a card completes and emits
"your task is now unblocked" naming every dependent it freed. But AN EMIT IS A
NOTIFICATION, NOT A MECHANISM: it tells the owner, and nothing enforces that the
owner acts. Measured on the live board: 10 cards across 5 agents sat `blocked` with
every dependency already `done`. The notification had done its job and the field
still lied.

`blocked` is a CLAIM — "something outside my control is stopping me". When the gate
is gone, the claim is false, and a false `blocked` converts "I have not done this"
into "I am PREVENTED from doing this". That is what makes a backlog untouchable.
