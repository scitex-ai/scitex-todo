"""Deferred-backlog triage: consume the fresh, expire the rotten.

Operator doctrine (2026-07-10): *"deferred が負債なんですよね... 消費が蓄積を
上回らないといけない... 古くなれば古くなるほど腐ります；タスクは鮮度が重要
です."* A deferred card is debt, and debt that nobody looks at is debt that
compounds.

Two mechanisms, deliberately NOT one sample:

**Pick-for-action** draws a handful of deferred cards and demands a decision
on each. It is weighted toward RECENCY. The first design here was the
opposite — oldest-first — and the operator caught it: drawing the oldest cards
feeds an agent the least valuable work it owns, so the backlog ends up eating
the agent. Fresh deferred work still has value; consume it before it rots.

**Expiry** handles the other tail. Old cards are never offered for action.
Past :data:`DEFAULT_EXPIRY_DAYS` the default outcome is cancellation, and an
owner must actively rescue a card to keep it. Age is a reason to discard, not
a reason to lovingly re-triage.

The anti-rot invariant
----------------------
A "keep deferred" decision must never restamp the age clock. If it did, a card
re-deferred every week would read as permanently young and would never expire —
the rot would be real and invisible at the same time. So the age clock reads
:func:`deferred_since`, which is stamped once on entry into ``deferred`` and
never reset, and the re-draw cooldown reads ``last_triaged_at``, which is a
separate field that exists only to stop the same card being drawn twice in a
row. One field for truth, one for politeness.

    A card is parked ONLY when it carries a non-empty, non-whitespace reason.
    An empty string, a whitespace string, ``True``, or any non-string is NOT a
    park — such a card sweeps normally.

    *** THE REASON IS THE POINT. ***

    This exemption exists because the sweep's predicate (``deferred`` +
    untouched) cannot tell two very different cards apart: one nobody got to —
    the case the sweep exists to catch — and one deliberately parked as a
    standing goal, whose real work lives in its children. For the second the
    nudge is unanswerable BY CONSTRUCTION: nothing to start, no gate to clear,
    and "untouched" is its steady state. It fires forever and says nothing.

    A boolean flag would have solved that and created something worse: a MUTE
    BUTTON. Mute buttons get pressed. Then every inconvenient card is muted, the
    sweep stops catching the abandoned cards it was built for, and the alarm is
    dead while still appearing to work — this codebase's recurring failure, a
    signal that keeps emitting after it stopped carrying information.

    Demanding a written reason means a card must PAY for its exemption, in
    words, where the next reader sees them. A park with no stated reason is
    precisely the abandonment the sweep should still catch, so it is not a park.
