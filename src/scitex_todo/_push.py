"""scitex-todo's self-contained push delivery wire.

Operator standing direction (lead a2a `8e51b1e072d14e2a81f5171cb5aca9f8`
+ `ffc6629c80e4462a8401fb7e4ebb7240`, 2026-06-12, operator TG12617): the
package must NOT depend on any external agent-runtime CLI for outbound
notifications. Push delivery lives inside scitex-todo itself; the
contract is HTTP, not Python imports (ecosystem doctrine).

Operator TG12618 follow-up: the long-term architecture is a dedicated
stdio MCP channel + a board-event poller per agent, wired via per-agent
`.mcp.json`, all owned by scitex-todo. That is queued as
PR (j) in the implementation roadmap. THIS module is the v1
**HTTP-push** half: a one-shot wake of the agent's turn URL with the
board-event body. Agents that read MCP inbox first (via the future
channel) will pick up the same event from both sides.

Configuration
-------------
``SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_TURN_URLS`` — JSON object mapping agent ids to
their turn URLs (any HTTP endpoint that accepts a JSON ``POST``):

    SCITEX_TODO_AGENT_TURN_URLS='{
        "proj-scitex-todo": "https://agents.example/v1/turn/proj-scitex-todo",
        "lead": "https://agents.example/v1/turn/lead"
    }'

Per-agent fallback ``SCITEX_TODO_TURN_URL_<AGENT_SLUG>`` (agent slug
upper-case + hyphens → underscores) — scitex-todo's own per-agent
turn-url env contract.

When neither env nor the user registry resolves a URL, delivery
returns ``no-turn-url-configured`` (fail-loud); scitex-todo has no
external-runtime fallback.

Loud-but-not-fatal policy (lead-confirmed)
------------------------------------------
* No URL for an agent → return ``{ok: False, reason:
  "no-turn-url-configured"}`` and log ERROR. Callers (UI / cron /
  CLI) decide what to surface; ``handle_nudge`` returns the
  ``ok=False`` to the UI toast and ``handle_comment``'s relay leaves
  a visible marker on the comment.
* HTTP 4xx/5xx → return ``{ok: False, reason: "http-error",
  status: <code>}``; never raise out into the request handler.
* Network exception / timeout → same shape, ``reason:
  "transport-error", error: <str>``.
* ``SCITEX_TODO_PUSH_DRY_RUN=1`` → no network; print the body to
  stdout for dev / test; returns ``ok=True, wire="dry-run"``.

Boot-time announcement (``announce_missing_at_boot``) lists the
agents in ``tasks.yaml`` that don't have a configured URL so the
operator can fix the gap before the first event.

#: 5 s client cap, the cron's POST timed out before the receiver had

#: nudge entries after the wire-shape fix landed (lead a2a
#: ``0b59485f`` 2026-06-13, P3a(c) pilot).
#:
#: There is no fast-ack path on ``/v1/turn`` (no ``wait=false`` /
#: ``dispatch_only=true`` / ``async=true`` flag — probed); so until
#: the receiver grows one, the pragmatic stopgap is a longer client
#: budget AND treating "we waited a long time + the response stream
#: never closed" as DISPATCHED rather than failure. 30 s lets typical
#: short turns complete cleanly; longer turns flip to
#: ``reason="dispatched"`` (still ok=True) so the cron doesn't fail
#: the whole batch over one slow turn.

#: Callers can override per-call with ``deliver(..., timeout=120.0)``

    can pass an explicit long ``timeout`` (e.g. 120.0).

    ``dispatched_is_ok`` (default ``True``) governs the read-timeout
    verdict. Background callers keep the default (timeout → ``ok=True,
    reason="dispatched"``). INTERACTIVE callers (the comment relay) pass
    ``False`` + a short ``timeout`` (:data:`NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_S`) so a
    timeout returns FAST with ``ok=False, reason="timeout"`` and the
