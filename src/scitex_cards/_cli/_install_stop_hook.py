"""``scitex-cards install-stop-hook`` — wire the Stop hook into settings.json.

WHY THIS SHIPS WITH CARDS (operator, 2026-07-18): 「フックとしてスクリプトを
用意してあげたらいいのかな？」. Registration was the last manual step between a
merged mechanism and a mechanism that actually runs — and a manual step is a
step that silently does not happen. The operator asked whether an agent with
cards left can still stop; it could, because the hook was registered nowhere.
A capability nobody wired protects nobody.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: it does not decide policy. Cards owns one verb — *does this
identity have runnable work, and what is the next action* — and this command
writes the four lines of JSON that let a runtime ask it. Anyone who prefers to
edit settings.json by hand should; this exists so nobody has to.

SAFETY, because this edits a file the user did not write:
* IDEMPOTENT — re-running never duplicates the entry.
* DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT. It prints what it would change and exits. ``--apply``
  is required to write, per the constitution's dry-run-every-mutation rule.
* BACKUP before every write, to ``<settings>.bak-<n>``, so the previous file
  survives even a bad edit.
* PRESERVES everything else. The file is read as JSON and re-serialised with
  only the hooks entry added — other hooks, permissions and env stay put.
